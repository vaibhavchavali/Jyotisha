[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar (Thirunavukkarasar), Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavachakar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Appar, also known as Tiru Navukkarasar, was a 7th-century Shaiva Samaya Acharya (Shaivite spiritual teacher) and the 21st of the Nayanmars. Born as Maruneekkiyar in a Vellalar family of Shaivites in Tiruvamur village, his early life was marked by tragedy with the death of his father, mother's Sati, and the death his sister's betrothed groom. Despite these hardships, Appar turned to spirituality, mastering Shastras and initially converting to Jainism. His sister, Tilakavathiar, a devoted follower of Bhagavan Shiva, prayed for his return to Shaivism.

Appar's conversion back to Shaivism was catalysed by a severe illness, cured by his sister's prayers and devotion to Bhagavan Shiva. He then became a fervent devotee, composing hymns and embracing the Panchakshara Mantra. His devotion led him into conflicts with Jains, resulting in several attempts on his life, including being thrown into a lime kiln, poisoned, and cast into the sea with a stone tied to him. Miraculously, he survived each attempt, further strengthening his faith.

He met with another great Nayanmar, Tiru Jnanasambandar, and together they worshipped at various temples, furthering the cause of Shaivism. Appar's journey was marked by divine experiences and miracles, including reviving a child from the dead and enduring tests by Bhagavan Shiva, who tried to tempt him with worldly pleasures. Appar remained steadfast in his devotion, living a life of unwavering faith and service to Bhagavan Shiva until he attained mukti at the age of 81, in the Agnipureeshwarar Shiva Temple in Thirupugalur (https://maps.app.goo.gl/npMR1TyvqDXcawnPA)."""
