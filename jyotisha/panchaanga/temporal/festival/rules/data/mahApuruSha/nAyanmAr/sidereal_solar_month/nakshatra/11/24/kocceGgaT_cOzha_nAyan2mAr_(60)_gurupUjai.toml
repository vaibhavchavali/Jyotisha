[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

In Chandra Tirtha, within the Chola kingdom, there was a sacred Shiva Lingam under a Jambu tree in a dense grove. A devout white elephant and a spider both worshiped the Lingam, but in conflicting ways. The elephant would remove the spider's web, thinking it dirtied the sacred site, while the spider spun webs to protect the Lingam from falling leaves. One day, their conflicting devotions led to a tragic end: the spider stung the elephant as it was removing the web, resulting in both their deaths.

This spider was reborn as a prince, the son of Chola king Shuba Devan and queen Kamalavati, who prayed to Bhagavan Nataraja of Chidambaram for a child. Born with red eyes due to delayed birth, he was named Kochengat Cholan. His mother passed away at his birth, and his father later retired for spiritual pursuits.

As king, Kochengat Cholan became a great patron of Shaivism. He constructed a temple at Tiru Anai Ka (now known as Tiruvanaikovil, https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZjkFyEot58UzTkNu8), at the same spot where he, as a spider, had once built webs over the Lingam. Throughout the Chola kingdom, he built numerous shrines and provided for the Brahmanas of Tillai, ensuring regular worship at Chidambaram. His contributions to Shaivism were immortalized in the poet Poygayar's work ‘Kalavazhi Narpathu’. Ultimately, Kochengat Cholan attained the divine abode of Bhagavan Shiva."""
