Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

The 3rd of the Nayanmars was Iyarpagai Nayanmar, a Vaishya and native of Kaveripoompattinam, renowned for his extraordinary charity, particularly towards devotees of Bhagavan Shiva. He had vowed never to refuse a request from a Shiva Bhakta. His devotion caught the attention of Bhagavan Shiva, who decided to test him. Disguised as a Brahmana, Bhagavan Shiva visited Nayanmar's home and, after being warmly welcomed, asked for Nayanmar's wife as a gift. Nayanmar, without hesitation or doubt, agreed to this unusual request, showcasing his unwavering devotion and belief in serving devotees.

The Nayanmar's wife, following her husband's decision and considering him as her god and law, consented to go with the Brahmana. As they left the town, Nayanmar accompanied them, armed for their protection. When the Nayanmar's in-laws learned of this event, they furiously confronted them, ready to fight to death rather than face the shame. Nayanmar, in his commitment to fulfill the Brahmana's wish, fought and killed his wife's relatives.

After reaching the temple of Tiruchaikadu, the Brahmana asked the Nayanmar to leave. As Nayanmar started to return home, he was called back by the Brahmana, only to find his wife alone and the Brahmana gone. At that moment, Bhagavan Shiva and Mother Parvati appeared, praising the couple's supreme devotion. They blessed the Nayanmar and his wife with a place in their divine abode. Nayanmar’s relatives (who earlier died at his hands) also attained the lotus feet of Bhagavan Shiva. This story illustrates the depth of unquestioning devotion and its alignment with Dharma, as well as the divine grace bestowed upon true devotees.
