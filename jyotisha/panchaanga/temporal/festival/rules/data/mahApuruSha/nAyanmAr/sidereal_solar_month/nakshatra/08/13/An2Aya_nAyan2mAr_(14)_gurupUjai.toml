[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

In Tirumangalam, a significant pilgrimage site in Mazhanadu (Tiruchirapalli District), resided the deity Samavedishvarar, known for purifying Parasurama of his sin and granting him an axe. Among the devotees in this divine place was a cowherd named Anayar, who earned his name due to his occupation. Anayar, the 14th Nayanmar, was deeply devoted to Bhagavan Shiva, showing reverence to the sacred Bhasma (ash) and Shiva Bhaktas of all castes. His unique form of devotion involved playing the Panchakshara Mantra of Shiva on his flute.

One day, under a Konrai tree, beloved by Bhagavan Shiva, Anayar played his flute, rendering the holy mantra. The melody was so enchanting that it mesmerized not only the cows and calves under his care but also the surrounding wildlife. Birds perched quietly to listen, peacocks danced rhythmically, and animals like deer, snakes, lions, elephants, and tigers, typically adversaries in nature, coexisted peacefully under the spell of the music. The environment itself seemed to pause, with rivers halting their flow and ocean waves calming, to savor the celestial music. Even heavenly beings like Vidyadharas, Kinnaras, and Devas were drawn to Anayar's location in their celestial vehicles, captivated by his flute's melody.

Bhagavan Shiva, deeply moved by Anayar's sincere devotion and the combined power of the enchanting music and the sacred Panchakshara Mantra, appeared before Anayar along with Mother Parvati. Acknowledging Anayar's devotion, Bhagavan Shiva blessed him and escorted him to Kailas, the divine abode."""
