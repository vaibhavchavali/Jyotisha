[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar (Thirunavukkarasar), Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavachakar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Notably, Manikkavachakar is not counted among the Nayanmars, but holds an equally exalted position among Shaiva Saints. Originally named Vadavurar, he was born into a family of Shaivite priests in 9th-century Thiruvadavur near Madurai. He ascended to the position of prime minister in the court of the Pandyan king. Legend has it that one day, while on a mission to buy war horses with funds entrusted by the king, Vadavurar encountered an ascetic, who was none other than Bhagavan Shiva, and his disciples under a tree. Captivated by the sage, Vadavurar embraced him as his spiritual teacher and, through meditation, attained enlightenment. This profound experience led him to forsake his worldly duties and responsibilities, using the royal funds to construct the Athmanathaswami Temple (Avudaiyarkoil).

Manikkavachakar sacred writings, known for their deep spiritual insight and beauty, make up the eighth volume of Thirumurai. His hymns, filled with longing, spiritual struggles, and yogic insights, glorify the Namasivaya mantra and emphasize the importance of developing love for Shiva. His profound influence extended to the king, who, after a divine encounter with Bhagavan Shiva, renounced his throne for a spiritual path.

Manikkavachakar's life and spiritual journey are commemorated in sculptures at the Madurai Meenakshi Sundareshvara Temple and the Chidambaram Nataraja Temple, where he spent his final years. His legacy continues to inspire devotion and the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment."""
