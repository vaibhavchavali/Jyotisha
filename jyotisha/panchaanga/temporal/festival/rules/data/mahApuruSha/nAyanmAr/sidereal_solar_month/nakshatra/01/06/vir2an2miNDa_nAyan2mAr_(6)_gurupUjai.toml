Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Viralminda Nayanmar was the 6th of the Nayanmars, born in the hilly region of Sengunru and belonging to a Vellala family. He was a devout follower of Bhagavan Shiva. He transcended ego and possessiveness and possessed a vision of equality, focusing his devotion on serving the devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, which he considered as significant as, if not more so than, worshipping Bhagavan Shiva directly. He believed that grace from Shiva was unattainable without first honoring His devotees and that disrespecting these devotees could obstruct one's path to salvation. Viralminda Nayanmar upheld this belief by first worshipping Shiva Bhaktas at the temple before offering prayers to the deity.

On a pilgrimage to Tiruvarur, Viralminda Nayanmar witnessed Sundaramurthi Nayanmar, another devotee, entering the sanctum sanctorum of the temple without acknowledging the other devotees present. Perceiving this as an insult to the Bhaktas, Viralminda Nayanmar boldly reprimanded Sundarar and declared him, and even Bhagavan Shiva, as outcasts for accepting such worship. This act was seen as an expression of Bhagavan Shiva's will, teaching the importance of respecting His devotees.

Sundarar, recognizing Viralminda Nayanmar's profound devotion and understanding, prostrated before him and sang a hymn in his praise. This gesture softened Viralminda Nayanmar's heart, leading him to acknowledge Sundarar's sincere devotion. Bhagavan Shiva, pleased with Viralminda Nayanmar's unwavering devotion to His Bhaktas, elevated him to lead the Shiva Ganas in the divine realm. This story highlights the paramount importance of devotion to Bhagavan Shiva's devotees in the path of spiritual elevation.
