[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

This Nayanmar, a devout Adi Shaiva from Seruviliputhur (presently Azhagaputhur), was deeply committed to serving Bhagavan Shiva as a temple priest. His daily ritual included bathing the deity with mantras and conducting Puja according to Shiva Agamas. During a severe famine, he faced extreme financial hardship and could not afford food, yet his devotion to his duties was unwavering. Despite his growing physical weakness, he persisted in performing the Puja, his love for the deity undiminished. On one occasion, as he was performing the Abhishekam (bathing ritual), he became so weak that he accidentally dropped the water pot onto the Lingam, leading him to faint from exhaustion.

In his unconscious state, he had a dream in which Bhagavan Shiva assured him of providing a gold coin daily in the temple until the end of the famine. This divine intervention would enable him to buy food and sustain himself. Upon awakening, he discovered the dream to be a reality; a gold coin miraculously appeared in the temple every day. This divine support allowed him to survive the famine and continue his devoted service. He maintained his dedication to the temple rituals and eventually attained the blessed abode of Bhagavan Shiva.

He is depicted with folded hands (Anjali mudra) and sometimes holding a pot of water! Pugazh Thunai Nayanmar, along with his wife Lakshmi, is revered in the front hall of the Padikasu Nathar Temple (Swarnapureeshwarar Temple https://maps.app.goo.gl/SxWDzUZtebtbp3WEA). Their lineage still upholds the tradition of serving as priests in the temple. As a tribute to the story of Pugazh Thunai Nayanar, worshippers place two coins at the base of the lingam, and then carry one of these coins back with them as a token."""
