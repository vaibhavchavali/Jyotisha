[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Perumizhalai Kurumba Nayanmar was a great devotee of both Bhagavan Shiva and his Guru, Sundaramurthi Nayanmar. He believed that the Guru is God in human form and devoted himself wholeheartedly to Sundarar. Through his faith and devotion, Kurumba Nayanmar attained all the Siddhis (psychic powers) and experienced deep ecstasy in both Shiva Bhakti and Guru Bhakti.

When Sundarar was about to leave the mortal world and attain his place in Shiva's abode, Kurumba Nayanmar was unable to bear the thought of being separated from his beloved Guru. Using his yogic powers, he learned of Sundarar's impending departure and decided to join him in the divine realm. Through the practice of Shiva Yoga, Kurumba Nayanmar shed his mortal body and reached Shiva's abode a day before Sundarar."""
