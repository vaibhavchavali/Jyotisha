[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Tiru Kurippu Thondar, a washerman from Kanchipuram, was renowned for his extraordinary devotion to Bhagavan Shiva. He earned his name by diligently serving Shiva devotees, washing their clothes and understanding their needs with just a glimpse of their faces.

Bhagavan Shiva, wanting to bless Tiru Kurippu Thondar, disguised Himself as a poor Shiva devotee and presented him with a dirty rag to wash. He demanded that the rag be returned before sunset, threatening to perish in the cold if it wasn't.

Unfortunately, just as Tiru Kurippu Thondar finished washing the rag, a heavy downpour began, making it impossible to dry it before sunset. Devastated by the thought of failing his service to the devotee, Tiru Kurippu Thondar dashed his head against a washing stone and wept in despair.

Moved by his sincere devotion, Bhagavan Shiva revealed Himself to Tiruthondar, commending his devotion and promising him a place in His divine abode. Overwhelmed with joy and gratitude, Tiruthondar fell at Bhagavan Shiva's feet and sang His praises, celebrating the divine encounter."""
