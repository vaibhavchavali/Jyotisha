[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Gananathar, a devout Brahmana from Sirkali, was the 38th of the Nayanmars. He was revered for his deep devotion to Bhagavan Shiva and was a source of spiritual guidance for many. Recognizing the varied abilities of those who sought his advice, he engaged them in service activities related to the temple, such as cleaning, making garlands, gardening, and lamp lighting. This approach not only transformed these individuals into Shiva Bhaktas but also infused a sense of devotion in them. Additionally, Gananathar was deeply devoted to Jnana Sambandar. All these great attributes contributed to him earning the grace of Bhagavan Shiva."""
