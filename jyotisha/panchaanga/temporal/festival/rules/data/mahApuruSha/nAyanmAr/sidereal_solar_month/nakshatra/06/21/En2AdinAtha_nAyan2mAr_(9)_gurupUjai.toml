Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Enadinatha Nayanmar, a toddy tapper (Shanar) by profession and a fervent devotee of Bhagavan Shiva, hailed from Eyinanur in the Chola Kingdom, located near Kumbakonam. The 9th of the Nayanmars, he revered not only Bhagavan Shiva but also any person who bore the mark of Vibhuti, the sacred ash, symbolizing the destruction of ego, illusions, and desires, leading to spiritual liberation.

Enadinatha Nayanmar, also an expert swordsman, earned his livelihood by training princes in fencing. He dedicated his earnings to serving Shiva Bhaktas, earning him popularity but also the envy of Atisuran, a less competent and vice-ridden rival in the same profession. Atisuran, desiring to defeat Enadinatha, challenged him to a fight, resulting in a fierce battle where many lives were lost, and Atisuran fled.

The next day, Atisuran proposed a one-on-one duel at a secluded location. Enadinatha agreed and met Atisuran at the agreed place. However, when Atisuran revealed the sacred ash on his forehead, Enadinatha, in his devotion to Bhagavan Shiva, refused to fight, recognizing Atisuran as a Shiva Bhakta. Despite his unwillingness to harm Atisuran, Enadinatha kept his sword, not wanting to compel Atisuran to sin by killing an unarmed person. Atisuran then took the opportunity to kill Enadinatha.

Bhagavan Shiva, impressed by Enadinatha's profound devotion and self-sacrifice for the sake of the sacred ash, appeared before him as he fell, and took him to His divine abode. This story highlights the immense reverence and selflessness of Enadinatha Nayanmar in his devotion to Bhagavan Shiva and His devotees.
