Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Amaraneedi Nayanmar, a Vaisya from Pazhaiyaarai in the Chola Kingdom, was a prosperous trader and a devout follower of Bhagavan Shiva. Despite his wealth and involvement in worldly affairs, he remained deeply committed to serving Shiva Bhaktas (devotees of Bhagavan Shiva). He practiced the sacred ritual of Maaheswara Puja, which involved reverently welcoming and serving Shiva Bhaktas, believing that serving them was as important as worshipping Bhagavan Shiva himself.

Desiring to devote himself more fully to this service, Amaraneedi Nayanmar moved to Tirunallur with his family, where he built a Mutt for accommodating Shiva Bhaktas. His devotion caught Bhagavan Shiva’s attention, who decided to test and reveal Nayanmar's devotion to the world. Disguised as a Brahmachari, Bhagavan Shiva visited Nayanmar's Mutt and entrusted him with a Kowpeenam (loincloth), claiming it was precious. However, Bhagavan Shiva made the Kowpeenam disappear, leading to a situation where Amaraneedi Nayanmar couldn’t return it.

Despite Amaraneedi Nayanmar's attempts to offer other wealth as compensation, the Brahmachari insisted on a Kowpeenam of equal value. When all Amaraneedi Nayanmar’s wealth could not match the weight of the Brahmachari’s Kowpeenam, representing the Vedas and Shastras, Amaraneedi Nayanmar, in desperation, placed himself, his wife, and child on the scale, and declared, ``If my service to the Shiva Bhaktas has indeed been genuine and heartfelt, may this scale balance with the other.'' Instantly, equilibrium was achieved between the two scales. This demonstrated that the value of Amaraneediar's devoted and altruistic service to the devotees of Bhagavan Shiva was on par with the significance of Bhagavan Shiva's Kowpeenam.

Witnessing this, the people around were amazed, and the Brahmachari revealed his true form as Bhagavan Shiva, accompanied by Mother Parvati. They blessed Amaraneedi Nayanmar and his family for their sincere service and charity, granting them eternal residence in Shiva’s Abode. The balance they were weighed on transformed into a celestial vehicle, carrying them to the divine realm. This story exemplifies the profound spiritual merit of selfless service and devotion to the devotees of the divine.
