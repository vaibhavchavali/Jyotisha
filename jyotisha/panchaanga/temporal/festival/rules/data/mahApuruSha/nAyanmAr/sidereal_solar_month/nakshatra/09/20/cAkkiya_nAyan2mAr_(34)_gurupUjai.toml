[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

This Nayanmar, a Vellala from Tirucchangamangai, grew disillusioned with worldly life and yearned for liberation. Initially swayed by Buddhist teachings, he eventually found his spiritual calling in Shaivism, convinced that intense devotion to Bhagavan Shiva was the true path to liberation. Despite maintaining the outward appearance of a Buddhist, his heart was devoted to Bhagavan Shiva.

In an unusual display of devotion, he would sit in an open Shiva temple, deeply meditating on the Lingam. One day, in a state of divine absorption, he unwittingly threw a stone at the Lingam. Realizing this act the next day, he interpreted it as divine will, understanding that Bhagavan Shiva accepts any offering made with sincere devotion. Henceforth, throwing a stone at the Lingam became his unique form of daily worship, a ritual he performed before eating.

On one occasion, just as he was about to eat, he remembered he had not performed his daily ritual. Driven by devotion, he rushed to the temple to throw a stone at the Lingam! Touched by his unorthodox yet profound devotion, Bhagavan Shiva appeared before him, blessed him, and ultimately took him to Kailasa, the abode of the divine."""
