Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe.

The 5th of them---Meypporul Nayanmar---a devout king of Sethi's hill tribes, was celebrated for his bravery, chivalry, and successful battles, creating a peaceful and prosperous kingdom. He deeply revered Bhagavan Shiva, seeing Him and His devotees as the embodiment of Absolute Truth, and held Shiva Bhaktas in high esteem, with daily prayers and festivals in temples.

His fame, however, stirred jealousy in Muthanathan, a neighbouring king. Muthanathan, defeated in battle, resorted to deceit, disguising himself as a Shiva Yogi to assassinate Nayanmar. Even as he lay dying from the betrayal, Nayanmar's concern was for the impostor's safety, instructing his guard to protect the assailant and honour him as a Shiva yogi as he appeared as one! His last words urged continued devotion and service to Shiva Bhaktas.

Bhagavan Shiva immediately manifested in front of him and bestowed his blessings with these words: ``Your unwavering devotion to my devotees, your boundless cosmic love, and your ability to see me even in a murderer have deeply impressed me. Due to these virtues, you are deserving of the Highest Abode, a place even the Devas aspire to but often cannot attain. You shall soon join me in My Divine Realm.'' After imparting this blessing, Bhagavan Shiva vanished, and the Nayanmar, aptly named as 'one who regards God as the sole reality' (`meypporuL`), ascended to Shiva's divine abode.
