Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Murthi Nayanmar, a devout Vaisya from Madura in the Pandya kingdom, was known for his devotion to Bhagavan Shiva, particularly through the offering of sandalwood paste. However, his devotion was tested when a Jain king from Karnataka conquered Madura and began persecuting Shaivites, including Murthi Nayanmar. Determined to spread Jainism and eliminate Shaivism, the king made it difficult to obtain sandalwood in Madura.

Despite these challenges, Murthi Nayanmar's devotion remained steadfast. After spending the entire day in a fruitless search for even a small amount of sandalwood for his worship, he found himself empty-handed. Heartbroken, he still made his way to the temple. There, struck by a sudden inspiration, he began to rub his own elbow vigorously as a substitute for the sandalwood! This intense action caused his hand to bleed profusely. Moved by this act of devotion, Bhagavan Shiva intervened, healing his elbow and commanding him to take up kingship, promising redress for his grievances and eventual ascension to Shiva's abode.

The Jain king died that night, and following an ancient custom, an elephant was sent out to choose the new ruler. The elephant selected Murthi Nayanmar at the temple. Though hesitant, Nayanmar accepted the kingship on the condition that he would continue his austere religious practices, including bathing in sacred ashes and adorning himself only with Rudraksham and matted locks. His primary goal as king was to foster the love of Bhagavan Shiva among his people.

Murthi Nayanmar's rule was marked by justice and wisdom. He remained a devout follower of Bhagavan Shiva throughout his reign and, fulfilling the divine promise, eventually attained Shiva's Abode.
