[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Pugal Chola Nayanmar was a revered king living in Uraiyur, part of the Chola kingdom. He was deeply devoted to Bhagavan Shiva and his devotees, earning him the admiration and love of his people who emulated his piety and virtues.

On a mission to collect tributes from the kings of Kuda Nadu in Karur, all complied except for a minor king named Adigan. Pugal Chola Nayanmar's army invaded Adigan's fort, leading to a battle where Adigan fled, his fort was destroyed, and many were killed. The army returned to Pugal Chola Nayanmar with the spoils of war, including the heads of those slain.

Among these heads, the king shockingly discovered one that bore the distinctive braid of a Shiva devotee. Overwhelmed with guilt for having inadvertently caused the death of a devotee, Pugal Chola Nayanmar decided to atone for this grave sin. He carried the head of the devotee on a golden plate, circled a large fire while chanting the sacred Panchakshara Mantra, and ultimately entered the fire himself. This act of remorse and devotion led him to be united with Bhagavan Shiva in the divine realm."""
