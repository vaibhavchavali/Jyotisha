[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

The 43rd Nayanmar was a Vaishya, and resided in Pennagadam, a part of the Chola kingdom. He was known for his devout service in the local temple and held a deep reverence for Shiva Bhaktas, seeing the divine presence of Bhagavan Shiva in them. His wife also actively supported him in these spiritual endeavours.

On one occasion, though, a man who had previously been a servant of the Nayanmar visited his house, disguised as a Shiva Bhakta. True to his devotional nature, the Nayanmar warmly welcomed the visitor, offering the traditional respect of washing his feet and venerating him. However, his wife, recognizing the man as their former servant, did not participate in the worship with the same enthusiasm.

Perceiving his wife's reluctance as a lack of devotion, the Nayanmar, in a drastic and shocking act, severed her hand. He then proceeded to continue his worship of the disguised Bhakta with undeterred focus. Through this extreme form of spiritual practice and dedication, he ultimately achieved union with the divine."""
