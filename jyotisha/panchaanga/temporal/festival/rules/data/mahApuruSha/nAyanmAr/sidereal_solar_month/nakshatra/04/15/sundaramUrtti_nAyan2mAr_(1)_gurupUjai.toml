Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Sundaramurti Nayanmar, born around 800 CE to parents who were themselves Nayanmars (`caDaiya nAyan2mAr (62)` and `icaiJAn2iyAr nAyan2mAr (63)`). He contributed the seventh volume of Thirumurai with his hymns. His life took a dramatic turn during his wedding, when an elderly ascetic adorned with sacred ash and rudraksha beads disrupted the ceremony. The ascetic claimed Sundarar as his servant, presenting a palm-leaf manuscript as evidence. Initially, Sundarar dismissed him as a 'pitthan' (madman). However, the authenticity of the palm leaf was confirmed, leading Sundarar to follow the ascetic to the Thiruvennainallur Shiva temple. There, the ascetic vanished into the inner sanctum. 

Bhagavan Shiva then appeared, requesting Sundarar to compose a hymn starting with the term ‘pitthan’, which he had used earlier. Sundarar's inaugural hymn, “Pittha pirai choodi” (O crazy one wearing the crescent moon), was dedicated to the deity at the Tiru Arul Turai Temple (now known as Kripapureeswarar Perumal Temple). This temple was one of the 82 Shiva temples he visited during his brief lifespan of just 18 years. Despite his short life, Sundarar's contributions significantly enriched Tamil Shaiva literature, marking him as a prominent Nayanmar.
