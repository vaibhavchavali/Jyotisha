[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Idangazhi Nayanmar, the king of Velas in Kodumbalur, was a devoted follower of Bhagavan Shiva. He ensured that all the Shiva temples in his region performed rituals as prescribed in the Shiva Agamas. In his domain, there was another devotee of Bhagavan Shiva who, due to financial difficulties, could no longer continue his practice of Maaheshwara Puja and the feeding of other devotees. Driven by his devotion and the need to continue his service, this devotee resorted to stealing paddy from Idangazhi Nayanmar's granary one night, only to be caught by the guards and brought before the king.

Upon learning that the devotee's intention was to serve Bhagavan Shiva's followers, Idangazhi Nayanmar released him. This incident profoundly impacted the king, leading him to a realization that his wealth was not truly his own, but belonged to Bhagavan Shiva and His devotees. In a remarkable gesture of devotion and generosity, Idangazhi Nayanmar granted all devotees of Bhagavan Shiva unrestricted access to his palace and granary, allowing them to take whatever they needed. This act of selflessness and dedication to the welfare of Bhagavan Shiva's devotees greatly enhanced the spread of Shaivism and garnered divine grace for Idangazhi Nayanmar."""
