[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

In Tiruchenkattangudi, within the Chola kingdom, there lived a devout Shaivite named Paranjyoti, belonging to a family of military leaders. He was the commander-in-chief under the Chola king and deeply devoted to Bhagavan Shiva, seeing devotion as the path to liberation.

After a successful military campaign against a Northern Indian king, Paranjyoti returned with spoils, pleasing his king. However, when the king learned of Paranjyoti's devotion to Bhagavan Shiva, he felt remorse for sending a devotee to war and rewarded Paranjyoti, urging him to focus on spiritual pursuits. Paranjyoti returned to his village and dedicated himself to worshipping Bhagavan Shiva and serving his devotees. He would not eat without first feeding a devotee of Shiva, humbly serving as a servant to them, earning the name Siruthondar (small servant).

Bhagavan Shiva, to reveal Siruthondar's devotion, tested him by appearing as a Vairavar (a Shaivite ascetic) outside his home. The ascetic refused to enter when only Siruthondar's maid and wife were home, but agreed to wait near the temple. When Siruthondar returned and learned of the ascetic, he joyfully invited him for food. The ascetic agreed, but put forth harsh conditions — he wanted to eat human flesh, specifically that of a healthy five-year-old boy, the only son of his parents, to be prepared by his parents!

Siruthondar, determined to fulfill the devotee's request, readily considered his son, who matched the description. His wife agreed, and they sacrificed their son, cooking his flesh for the ascetic. When the ascetic demanded to eat with another devotee, Siruthondar readied himself for the meal! The ascetic's request then escalated, demanding the presence of Siruthondar's son at the meal. Following the ascetic's insistence, Siruthondar called for his son, Sirala, and to everyone's astonishment, the boy miraculously appeared, alive and unharmed. They found no sign of the ascetic in the kitchen, and the cooked meat had vanished. At that moment, Bhagavan Shiva appeared, blessing Siruthondar and his family, and took them to His divine abode."""
