[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Sirappuli Nayanmar, a devout Brahmana from Tiruvakur in the Chola kingdom, was deeply devoted to Bhagavan Shiva and His devotees. He also conducted Vedic sacrifices to propitiate Bhagavan Shiva. He demonstrated his devotion through sincere worship and service. A significant aspect of his spiritual practice was the constant repetition of the Panchakshara Mantra, day and night. All these earned him the supreme grace of Bhagavan Shiva."""
