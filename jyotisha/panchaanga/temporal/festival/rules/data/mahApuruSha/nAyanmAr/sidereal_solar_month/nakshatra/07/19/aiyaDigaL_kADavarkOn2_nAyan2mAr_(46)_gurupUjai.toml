[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Aiyadigal Kadavarkon Nayanmar was a Pallava king who reigned over Kanchi and played a significant role in promoting Shaivism among his people. Eventually, he became disillusioned with the material world and chose to renounce his worldly duties. After ensuring his son succeeded him on the throne, Aiyadigal Kadavarkon Nayanmar embarked on an extensive pilgrimage. During his travels, he visited numerous shrines, expressing his devotion by singing hymns in praise of Bhagavan Shiva. His deep devotion and spiritual dedication pleased Bhagavan Shiva, who blessed him with His darshan."""
