[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Mangaiyarkarasiyar, the 50th of the Nayanmars was the wife of another Nayanmar, Ninra Seer Nadumara Nayanmar, who was earlier known as Koon Pandyan, the hunchbacked Pandyan king of Madurai. Tiru Jnana Sambandar, a revered Nayanmar, arrived in Madurai and was invited into the city by Kulacchirai Nayanmar. Despite attempts by the Jains to harm Sambandar, his divine singing miraculously cured the king of his hunchback and alleviated his pain, leading to his return to Shaivism. Following his conversion, the king conquered northern kings at Tirunelveli, spreading Shaivism in those regions with the support of his wife. Both he and Mangayarkarasiyar deeply revered Sambandar and their dedication to their guru and Shaivism ultimately brought them divine grace."""
