[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Kazharsinga Nayanmar, a devout follower of Bhagavan Shiva and a Pallava king from the Kadavar lineage, was instrumental in spreading Shaivism by conquering northern kingdoms. During one of his many pilgrimages, he visited the Tiruvarur temple with his queen. While circumambulating the temple, the queen unintentionally smelt a flower fallen on the ground, designated for Bhagavan Shiva's worship. Seruthunai Nayanmar, a dedicated Vellala devotee serving in the temple, saw this as a disrespectful act towards Bhagavan Shiva and impulsively cut off the queen's nose as a penalty for her indiscretion.

Alarmed by his queen's cries, King Kazharsinga rushed to the scene. Upon understanding the situation from Seruthunai Nayanmar, who explained the queen's act, the king deemed the punishment insufficient and further punished the queen by severing her hand that had touched the flower! This extreme act of devotion from both the king and Seruthunai Nayanmar was celebrated by the people, and they were showered with celestial flowers as a mark of divine approval. Both Kazharsinga Nayanmar and Seruthunai Nayanmar earned the grace of Bhagavan Shiva for their unwavering devotion. Bhagavan Shiva appeared and took Kazharsinga Nayanmar with Him, while also restoring the queen's nose and hand."""
