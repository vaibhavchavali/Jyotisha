[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

This Nayanmar, a minor chieftain from Tiru Munaipadi, was a fervent devotee of Bhagavan Shiva and a staunch supporter of Shaivism. On every Tiruvathirai day, he would hold special Pujas, feed Shiva devotees regardless of their appearance, and generously offer each devotee a hundred gold coins.

During one such event, a devotee arrived with his body covered solely in sacred ashes, completely naked, causing discomfort among the other devotees. The Nayanmar, perceiving this, fell at the devotee's feet, and demonstrated his profound respect by not only feeding the naked devotee with greater reverence but also by offering him double the usual gift — 200 gold coins! This incident highlights the Nayanmar's deep understanding and acceptance that every devotee is an embodiment of Bhagavan Shiva, regardless of their external appearance."""
