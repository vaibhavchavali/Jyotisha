Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Eripatha Nayanmar, a dedicated devotee of Bhagavan Shiva from Karuvur in the Chola Kingdom, was known for his unwavering service to Shiva Bhaktas. He always carried an axe to protect them and would not hesitate to use it against anyone who threatened harm to these devotees. Shivakami Andar, another Shiva Bhakta in the same city, was devoutly engaged in daily worship of Bhagavan Shiva.

On a festive day, an incident occurred where the king’s pet elephant, returning from a bath, went on a rampage and disrupted Shivakami Andar's ritual of offering flowers to Bhagavan Shiva. The elephant scattered the flowers and ran off, leaving Shivakami Andar distressed. Hearing his cries, Eripatha Nayanmar, in his zeal to protect a fellow devotee, chased down and killed the elephant and its mahouts with his axe.

When the king arrived and learned that Eripatha Nayanmar had killed the elephant, he initially reacted with anger but soon realized that Eripatha must have had a justified reason. Eripatha explained that his actions were in response to the elephant's disrespect towards a Shiva Bhakta, which the king interpreted as a sin against Bhagavan Shiva. The king, feeling responsible and guilty, offered his sword to Eripatha, asking him to execute him. Eripatha, struck by the king’s noble response, attempted to punish himself instead, which the king prevented.

At this point, divine intervention occurred. A heavenly voice explained that this was all Bhagavan Pasupatheesvarar's divine play to demonstrate the devotion of His followers. The elephant and mahouts miraculously woke up as though from sleep, and Shivakami Andar's basket of flowers was restored. The king and Eripatha Nayanmar embraced in mutual respect and joy, with the king riding his elephant again and Eripatha continuing his service to Shiva Bhaktas. Eripatha Nayanmar eventually left his mortal coil, on this day of Masi Hastam, and attained Bhagavan Shiva's abode, his devotion having been divinely recognised and celebrated.
