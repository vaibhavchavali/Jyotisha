[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Eyarkon Kalikama Nayanmar, a devout Vellala from Tiruperumangalam in Ponni Nadu, was a dedicated follower of Bhagavan Shiva and belonged to the esteemed Eyarkudi family known for its military leaders. He was deeply troubled by the news that Sundaramurthi Nayanmar had utilised Bhagavan Shiva to resolve a personal dispute with his wife, which led him to question Sundaramurthi's devotion and his own piety.

In response to Kalikama Nayanmar's doubts, Bhagavan Shiva intervened by afflicting Kalikama Nayanmar with colic and informed him in a dream that only Sundaramurthi could cure it. However, Kalikama Nayanmar, staunch in his principles, chose to die rather than seek help from Sundaramurthi. Concurrently, Bhagavan Shiva instructed Sundaramurthi in a dream to heal Kalikama Nayanmar.

Upon Sundaramurthi's arrival, Kalikama Nayanmar had already ended his life. This act of defiance led to a dramatic scene where Sundaramurthi, in despair, attempted to take his own life. At this critical moment, Bhagavan Shiva's grace miraculously revived Kalikama Nayanmar, leading to a heartfelt reconciliation between the two devotees. Following this profound experience, Kalikama Nayanmar devoted his life to serving Bhagavan Shiva and His devotees, ultimately attaining a place in the divine abode."""
