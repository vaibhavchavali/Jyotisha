[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Somasira Nayanmar, the 33rd Nayanmar was a Brahmana from Tiruvambur, deeply devoted to Bhagavan Shiva and served His devotees from all castes, transcending societal norms. His dedication to conducting Yagas (ritual sacrifices) was remarkable, as he did so without any selfish motives, a rarity in his time. Yagas were typically performed with the expectation of tangible rewards, but Somasira's selfless approach indicated his advanced spiritual maturity, reflecting the traits of a true Jnani (one who has realized the Self) and Karma Yogi (one who selflessly performs actions).

Additionally, his devotion to his Guru, Sundaramurthi Nayanmar, was profound. He lived in Tiruvarur, fully committed to his spiritual teacher, a testament to the power of Guru Bhakti (devotion to the guru)."""
