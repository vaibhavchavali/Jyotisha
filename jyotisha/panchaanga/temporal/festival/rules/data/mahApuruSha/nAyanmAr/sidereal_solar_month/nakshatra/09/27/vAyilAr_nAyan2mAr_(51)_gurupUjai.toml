[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

This Nayanmar, a Vellala from Mylapore, was a fervent devotee of Bhagavan Shiva. His devotion transcended the physical forms of worship, as he engaged in profound mental worship. He envisioned constructing temples in his mind, where he performed Manasic (mental) worship. In his inner sanctum, he built the temple of unceasing remembrance, ignited the radiant lamp of self-realization, bathed the divine in the waters of eternal Ananda (bliss), and offered his utmost love as the offering. Through this profound and abstract form of devotion, he achieved salvation."""
