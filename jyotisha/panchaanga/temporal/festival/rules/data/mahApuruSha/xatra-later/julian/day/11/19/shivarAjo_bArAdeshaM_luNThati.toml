[description]
en = "shivAjI invaded bArdesh with 5k foot and 1k horse, plundered  and withdrew after 3 days. 2 Portuguese priests were killed. An English account from 10 days later says that the cause was irritation at roman catholic fanaticism (which was then rescinded by the Portuguese viceroy) - but this is not mentioned in Portuguese or Dutch letters and the later agreement, which say that the objective was to capture the desai-s from there who were using it as a base for their looting operations with Portuguese support."
