Small commando units (one of them 100 infantry and 50 cavalry) of Odisha's Eastern Ganga Dynasty king Gajapati Narasimhadeva-I, pounced on a big Mamluk force under Tughril Khan (fooled into complacency by a faux retreat) near Katasin/Contai fort (near South Bengal). The Gajapati's army then chased them all the way out of South Bengal (all the way beyond lakhnor fort, 70 miles away).

### Context
Narasimhadeva had laid a siege on  Lakhanuti(Bengal) for the first time in Nov 1243. This shocked the Mamluk Governor Tughril Tughan Khan, who had to gather his forces and gave the  clarion of Islamic jihAd against the Gajapati. The Ganga army hd to retreat till Katasin(Contai) of South West Bengal. The Mamluk army was overjoyed as they had apparently forced the Eastern Ganga army to withdraw, and camped near the Katasin fort. They weren't aware that it was a fake retreat. The Mamluks weren't alert and were infact quite excited on seeing the war elephants left behind for free.
