[description]
en = "Even as mogol forces were wasting time trying to capture siMhagaD, shivAjI rapidly advanced to sUrat and surprised everyone. The Governor hid in his castle and sent an emissary who tried to murder shivAjI with his dagger - his hand was cut off by an alert guard, spilling blood on shivAjI. Some marATha-s were upset and cried to kill the prisoners - but shivAjI stopped them in time (as related by English witnesses). After a good sack, the rAjA retreated on 9th. The Dutch Iversen remarked that it was as if shivAjI was fulfilling his dream of pulling Awrangzeb's beard."
