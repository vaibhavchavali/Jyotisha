nAthUrAm goDse (assisted by Narayan Apte) killed MK gAndhi (who DID NOT say "He Ram") in a stupid move which would set back Hindu interest by decades. Millions of Indians mourned Gandhi's assassination; the Hindu Mahasabha was vilified and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was temporarily banned.

In Anti-brAhmin riots (mostly by so-called marATha-s taking advantage of the situation),innocent brAhmaNas were killed (on the first day alone, 15 in Bombay and 50 in Pune), thousands of offices and homes were also set on fire. Greatest violence took place in Satara, Kolhapur and Belgaum. The biggest violence took place in the seven Patwardhan (Chitpawan) princely states such as Sangli, where the remarkably advanced factories owned by Chitpawans were largely destroyed. Here, Jains and Lingayats joined the Marathas in the attacks. The events hastened the integration of Patwardhan states (by march 1948) into the Bombay province.

N Godse was later executed on 15 November 1949.
