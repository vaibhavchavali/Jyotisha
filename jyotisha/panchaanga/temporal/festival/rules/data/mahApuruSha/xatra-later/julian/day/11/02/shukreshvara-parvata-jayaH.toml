Ahom ruler Chakradhvaja Singha (Supangmung, 1663-1670) recaptures Itakhuli (shukreshvara hill) and some other guvahATi garrissons from Mogol governor  Sayed Firoj Khan. The enemy was chased down to the mouth of the Manaha river, the old boundary between Assam and Mughal India (prior to Mir Jumla's campaign). On receiving the news of victory the king cried out-"It is now that I can eat my morsel of food with ease and pleasure".

Background: Aurangzeb, after ascending on the throne of Delhi, ordered Mir Jumla to invade Cooch Behar and Assam and re-establish Mughal prestige in eastern India. The western Ahom kingdom was then rife with envy and resentment. So, in 1662 he had succeeded. King Jayadhvaja retreated to the hills, abandoning much treasure, later sent his daughter and niece to mogol harem. Chakradhwaj Singha, who succeeded him, was against any payment at all on principle. He shouted out from his throne: – "Death is preferable to a life of subordination to foreigners". In 1665 the king summoned an assembly of his ministers and nobles and ordered them to adopt measures for expelling the Mughals from western Assam, adding—"My ancestors were never subordinate to any other people; and I for myself cannot remain under the vassalage of any foreign power. I am a descendant of the Heavenly King and how can I pay tribute to the wretched foreigners."
