tukArAm Omble died stopping jihAdi terrorist Ajmal Kasab in Mumbai on this day. 

## Background and events
Omble joined the police as a constable in 1991 after retiring from the Indian Army's Signal Corps as a naik. He was an ASI with the Mumbai Police. On 26/11 he and his team were guarding one of the checkposts when they were approached by two terrorists in a hijacked car. After an initial shootout, one of the terrorists died inside the car, while the other, Ajmal Kasab got out of the car and lay down to pretend surrender. As unarmed Omble approached him, Kasab got up and tried to open fire. Omble stood in front of him and held on to the barrel of Kasab's rifle, thus preventing the bullets from hitting anyone else but him. The rest of the team managed to overpower and apprehend Kasab. Omble had taken over 40 bullets from an Ak-47 at point blank range and did not survive.
