As the British forces at kAnpur surrendered on 25 June 1857, Nana was declared Peshwa in late June.

On June 27, the british making their way on gangA at Satichaura Ghat were killed or captured (it's unclear who fired teh first shot). Around 120 women and children were taken prisoner and eventually moved to Bibighar; later more were added. 

Using them for bargaining failed - and eventually, they were massacred on July 15 despite protestations (including hunger strike) of nAnA-saheb's family, and hesitency / refusal of the soldiers - partly in anger at reports of violence by British against villagers. Finally, owner of the place, begum hussaini khAnum, a harlot, hired butchers to finish them off with cleavers. The British extracted their terrible vengence later.
