en = """On this day, 5 synchronised bomb blasts took place within a span of few minutes - around 30 died, and 100 injured. Carried out by Indian Mujahideen, an offshoot of Students Islamic Movement of India. In their arbi hindi email, they said: "This time with the Message of Death, dreadfully terrorising you for your sins. And thus our promise will be fulfilled. Inshallah...Do whatever you want."

## Context
This came after May 13 Jaipur bombings (63 killed), 25 July bengaLUru bombings and 26 July Ahmedabad bombings (56 killed). 

## Aftermath
Several people (many engineers, scrap dealer, hotlier) were arrested. Abdul Qureshi (Quraysh = Islamic prophet's tribe) aka Al Arabi, a SIMI activist with IT background was alleged to be closely involved. He was arrested after a gun fight in 2018.
