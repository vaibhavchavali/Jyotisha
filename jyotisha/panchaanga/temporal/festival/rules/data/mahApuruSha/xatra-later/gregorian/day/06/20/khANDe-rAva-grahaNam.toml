On 20th June 1761, the royalist divAn Khande Rao was surrendered to the new userper Haidar by a cornered Krishnaraja Wodeyar II. Haidar imprisoned him in a iron cage (Page 204, Chapter 5 of Political history of Karnataka under the nawabs) and shifted him to Bangalore where he died a year later. Although khande Rao had let haidar escape, treated Haidar's family with utmost respect when they were captured, Haidar behaved and repaid him in a very brutal manner. Even Haidar's wife, Fakhrunnisa, did not prevail upon Haidar to give a milder punishment to the gallant foe.

## Context
- Khande Rao came in contact with Haidar Ali in August 1756 when the king entrusted him with 50k gold pieces to be given to Sahbas Sahib (brother of Haidar) and Haidar to enable them to raise an army to defeat the Dalawai brothers who had virtually imprisoned him (the king) in his own palace.
- Haidar rose to power under Khande Rao with the countenence of Karachuri Nanjarajaiah. In 1758, Khande Rao was made "Dewan" on the recommendation of Haidar and the Dalawais (including Karachuri Nanjarajaiah) were side-lined.
- By 1759, it was clear that Haidar was getting more and more revenue districts assigned to himself and Khande Rao had seen through Haidar's intention to fleece the king.
- The Wodeyar King sought the assistance of the Mahratta army and Khande Rao wrote several letters to George Pigout, Governor General at Madras for help.
- On 26th August 1760, Khande Rao attacked Haidar at Srirangapatna but let Haidar flee out of sentiment, with the promise that he would retire away from maisUru. Haidar did not keep his promise - he tried regrouping and attacking. 
- Sadly, shortly thereafter marATha forces were recalled after the defeat at pANIpat. 
- Haidar rushed to the feet of the dalvai Karachuri Nanjarajaiah - the latter was swayed and basically let Haidar act on his behalf - sowing utter confusion in the maisUru king's troops. 

## Aftermath
- On 3rd july 1761, Haidar formally occupied the Fort at Srirangapatna and declared himself as "Sarvadhikari and Regent" to the King. Karachuri Nanjarajaiah, who wanted to re-establish himself at Srirangapatna, was deceived for the second time by Haidar.
