On 3rd july 1761, Haidar formally occupied the Fort at Srirangapatna and declared himself as "Sarvadhikari and Regent" to the King. Former dalavAi Karachuri Nanjarajaiah, who wanted to re-establish himself at Srirangapatna and had provided crucial assistance to Haidar upon being emotionally swayed, was deceived for the second time by Haidar.

## Context
- Khande Rao came in contact with Haidar Ali in August 1756 when the king entrusted him with 50k gold pieces to be given to Sahbas Sahib (brother of Haidar) and Haidar to enable them to raise an army to defeat the Dalawai brothers who had virtually imprisoned him (the king) in his own palace.
- Haidar rose to power under Khande Rao with the countenence of Karachuri Nanjarajaiah. In 1758, Khande Rao was made "Dewan" on the recommendation of Haidar and the Dalawais (including Karachuri Nanjarajaiah) were side-lined.
- By 1759, it was clear that Haidar was getting more and more revenue districts assigned to himself and Khande Rao had seen through Haidar's intention to fleece the king.
- The Wodeyar King sought the assistance of the Mahratta army and Khande Rao wrote several letters to George Pigout, Governor General at Madras for help.
- On 26th August 1760, Khande Rao attacked Haidar at Srirangapatna but let Haidar flee out of sentiment, with the promise that he would retire away from maisUru. Haidar did not keep his promise - he tried regrouping and attacking. 
- Sadly, shortly thereafter marATha forces were recalled after the defeat at pANIpat. 
- Haidar rushed to the feet of the dalvai Karachuri Nanjarajaiah - the latter was swayed and basically let Haidar act on his behalf - sowing utter confusion in the maisUru king's troops. 
- On 20th June 1761, the royalist divAn Khande Rao was surrendered to the new userper Haidar by a cornered Krishnaraja Wodeyar II.
