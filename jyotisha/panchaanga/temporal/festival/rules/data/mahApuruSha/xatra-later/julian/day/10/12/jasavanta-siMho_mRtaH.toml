jasvant singh rAthoD of mArvAr died on this day in kAbUl. Excited awrangzeb is said to have exclaimed: “darwaza-e-kufr shikast! shikast!” - door that saved Kafirs, fall! Same year Jazia was imposed all over the empire. Awrangzeb then treid to annex mArvAr and convert its royal infant heir to Islam - only to be foiled by brave durgAdAs.

In a letter written in 1659, Awrangzeb speaks of Maharaja Jaswant Singh as "the infidel who has destroyed mosques and built idol-temples on their sites." Maharaja Jaswant Singh was later suspected by the mogols of covertly aiding shivAjI in his daring raid on shaiste khAn in puNe.
