The mogol king bAbUr defeated rAjaputras under rANA sangrAmasiMha of mevAr. 

## Battle
Rana concluded there was no choice but pitched battle. The Mughal army numbered around 25k, and Mewar army somewhere between 10-20k. Don't go by the claimed 2 lakh, its nonsense. The Mughal artillery was concentrated in the center. Mewaris attacked both wings with more troops, staying away from the Mughal trump card- the artillery. However, both Mughals managed to hold.

Babur tried a risky move- ordered his idle center to attack w.o safety of carts. This worked, as the Mewar army's center was depleted and most sent to the wings. This was risky, as a failure wouldve meant total rout for the Mughals. Despite pushing back mewar center, the line held. Rana was shot by a bullet and fell unconscious, causing great confusion in the Rajput army. The replacement was a poor commander. 

This wasn't bad generalship, nor purely a technological edge.


## Aftermath
Rana Sanga managed to evade capture and escape to Chittor, where he was poisoned to death by 30 January 1528.

## Background
Rajput ruler of Mewar, Rana Sanga, sent an ambassador to Babur at Kabul, offering to join in Babur's attack on the Sultan. Sanga offered to attack Agra, while Babur would attack the Lodhis at Delhi. But he changed his mind after realizing that bAbur, unlike taimUr, intended to stay in India. Rana Sanga had built a formidable military alliance against Babur. He was joined by virtually all the leading Rajput kings from Rajasthan. Some Lodi afghAns also joined.

Babur denounced the Afghans who joined the alliance against him as kafirs and murtads (apostates from Islam). Babur proceeded to renounce future consumption of wine, broke his drinking cups, poured out all the stores of liquor on the ground and promulgated a pledge of total abstinence. bAbur wrote: "It was a really good plan, and it had a favourable propagandistic effect on friend and foe."
