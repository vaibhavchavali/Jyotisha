British police shot and killed peaceful protestors intending host the tricolour at vidurAshvattha near GauribidanUr.

## Events

> Inspired by the Shivapura satyagraha, on April 25, 1938, a group of Indian National Congress leaders and villagers from neighbouring Hindupur and Gauribidanur decided to take out a similar procession at Vidurashwatha. The local jatre was also underway at the time, and had drawn thousands of people. The group planned to hoist the flag among the trees behind the temple. Officials caught wind of the planned dhwaja satyagraha and imposed prohibitory orders in the area. Yet, hundreds waited under the shade of trees in the sun to hoist the flag.
> 
> An hour later, a police battalion arrived. From 1.30 pm to 5.30 pm, they fired 96 rounds of bullets. Official British figures say around 10 people were killed. “However, the death of 32 villagers has been documented, including Gowramma, a nine-month pregnant woman,” said C Nagaratna, former school principal and member of the Swatantrya Smaraka Abhivrudhi Samiti, which maintains the museum. Eyewitness accounts estimate that over 100 people were killed that day, she said.

## Aftermath
Several of the bodies were retrieved during the night. Victims were undercounted the next day. A memorial was built at the site in 2009, with names of martyrs engraved on a plaque.
