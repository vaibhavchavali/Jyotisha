One of the earliest well-recorded hindu-muslim riots started on this Holi-day in Ahmedabad.

## Trigger
- The Ahmedabad account attributes the trigger to Holi colors falling on an indignant muslim passerby.
- The Delhi account (seemingly more concise and confused) attributes it to burning of Holika over the objections of a muslim neighbor.

## Riots
Riots proceeded for two days. Hindu (+Jain) side was led by Kapur Chand, a well connected jeweller. Muslim side was led by Abdul Aziz, a cap merchant from the Sunni Bohra community. Professional rivalry existed between them. 

The muslim mob was actively roused, and involved a charismatic Sufi preacher Muhammad Ali as per the Ahmedabad account. They tried and failed to get the Qazi to join them - and burned his house out of spite. They then attacked Kapur Chand and co; who defended themselves well - employing well paid Muslim musketeers according to Ahmedabad account.

## Climax
The Governor of the subah, Daud Khan (a rather unorthodox person who's reputed to have had an idol in his house) sided with the influential Hindu Kapur Chand. The Qazi, Khairullah Khan, follwed suit. According to them, the Muslim case had no legal merit. But a rival Delhi muslim faction seems to have supported the Muslim rioters and forced the Hindu side to become conciliate.

## Aftermath
Next year, according to Ali Muhammad Khan, Mirat-i Ahmadi - on the eve of Id al azha, a Bohra attempt to sacrifice a cow was thwarted by a Hindu havaldAr under the governorship of mahArAja Ajit singh. But, a Bohra Muslim mob formed and succeeded in retrieving the cow and slaughtering it after the Id prayer.
