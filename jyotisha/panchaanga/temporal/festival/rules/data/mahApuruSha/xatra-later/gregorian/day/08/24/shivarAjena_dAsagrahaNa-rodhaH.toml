Shivaji notified the Dutch to stop slave trade:

> In the days of the Moorish [Muslim] government it was allowed for you to buy male slaves and female slaves here [the Karnatak], and to transport the same, without anyone preventing that. But now you may not, as long as I am master of these lands, buy male or female slaves, nor transport them. And in case you were to do the same, and would want to bring [slaves] aboard, my men will oppose that and prevent it in all ways, and also not allow that they may be brought back in your house; this you must observe and comply with.

Dutch original:

> Voor desen heeft dit land onder 't moors gebied geweest en doen stond het u edele vrij slaven en slavinnen te kopen, en verkopen dog dat sal nu niet mogen wesen, want mijn volk heeft last 't selve te beletten, indien u edele het egter wilde doen, die ook niet toelaten sullen, dat u edele deselve in in sijn huijs of schip brengt, maar sullen se u edele ontnemen en op vrije voeten stellen.

## Context
shivAjI had embarked on a remarkable "digvijaya" campaign towards the south. Representatives from many domestic and foregin powers visited, paid tribute and sought continuation of trading privileges.
