A roughly 1k+ strong Muslim mob burnt 59 Hindu pilgrims alive in Godhra, GJ. Maulvi Husain Haji Ibrahim Umarji, the alleged mastermind, was acquitted due to lack of evidence - though they managed to convict around 31 people; and the courts termed it a well planned attack. Riots followed, resulting in 1k-2k deaths (~ 75% muslim).
