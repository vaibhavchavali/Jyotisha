On this day, Dhirendranath Datta, the 84-year-old freedom fighter, was arrested along with his son, Dilipkumar Datta, from his residence in the Comilla district by the Pakistan army. The duo was taken to the Mainamati Cantonment where they were tortured to death. Their bodily remains were disposed of in such a manner that they were never found.

## Context
Born on November 2 in 1886, Datta fought for India’s independence from British rule. He participated in agitation against the Partition of Bengal (1905), the Non-Cooperation movement (1920-1922) and the Quit India movement (1942-1945). He was arrested several times for his anti-British stance. After the partition (which he opposed), as a parliamentarian, he advocated recognition of bengAli and opposed West Pakistani direct rule.

Operation Searchlight, specially targetting Bengali Hindus and nationalists, began a few days ago. It marked the beginning of the genocide in bangladesh as well as the Bangla war of liberation. Members of the Pakistani military and supporting Islamist militias from Jamaat-e-Islami (lit. Collective of Islamists) killed up to 3 million people, raped between 200k and 400k Bengali women. A further eight to ten million people, mostly Hindus, fled to India.
