## Aftermath
- Among the killed was Nilkanth rao Patwardhan, as seen from an excerpt of casualty report of 9 March 1771 from the Maratha army - Of 8 chiefs killed was 'Khasa Nilkanth rao'.
- Srirangapatna placed under a siege for 6 weeks. 
- With the capture of Delhi and the defeat of the Nizam in 1763, Hyder and Tipu (over four campaigns) until 1771, Madhavrao Peshwa had regained all the lost ground at Panipat by 1771.
- Hyder eventually paid a 50 lakh indemnity & signed a treaty.
  - This reprieve in 1771 was a blunder. It allowed Raghoba to ally with Hyder after Madhava Rao's death. Mysore regained territories lost by supporting Raghoba. Marathas had to fight a resurgent Mysore again for 2 decades. 
  - Hindus of kerala and kodagu paid a steel price as well.
