On this day, began the large scale massacre of over 20k Hindu and sikhs at mIrpur in pAkistAn occupied kAshmIr.

In the morning, jihAdi-s entered mIrpur city. Rioting began. Of the minority population, only about 2,500 Hindus or Sikhs escaped through the border to Jammu and Kashmir along with the State troops. The jihAdi-s killed every hindu and sikh - shooting, hacking, even slitting throats while chanting kAlima-s (eg. at the gurdwara at Ali Baig which had been turned into a prison camp). Around 5k women were raped and abducted - though many committed mass suicide to escape that fate. 

## Aftermath
In March 1948, the ICRC rescued 1,600 of the survivors from Ali Baig. By 1951, only 790 non-Muslims remained in areas that came to comprise Azad Kashmir; down from a previous population of 114,000 which used to live there. Governments of sheikh abdullah and successors did not give them resident status.
