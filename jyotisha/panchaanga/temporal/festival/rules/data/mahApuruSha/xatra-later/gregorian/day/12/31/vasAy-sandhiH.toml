en = """
In a selfish and short-sighted move, bAjI-rAv 2 signed the Treaty of Bassein and became a subordinate ally of the British after running away from yashvantrAv holkar's vectorious army. Earlier he had taken shiNDe's side in the shiNDe-holkar rivalry and had executed yashvantrAv's brother by elephant trampling. Soon, with successful execution of the "divide and conquer" strategy, the East India Company forces won against the shiNDe army in isolation; and then the holkar army.
