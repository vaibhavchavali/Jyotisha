On this day, Kunwar Singh, masterfully deceiving the british forces, crossed gangA into bihAr. He had spread word that there are no boats and that he would cross the river with elephants at a different spot, even as he gathered boats at a differnt point. Douglas' army caught up and began to shoot at their boat. One of the bullets shattered Singh's left wrist. Singh felt that his hand had become useless and that there was the additional risk of infection due to the bullet-shot. He drew his sword and cut off his left hand near the elbow and offered it to the Ganges.
