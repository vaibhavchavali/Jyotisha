Rajaram Jat died in a battle near Bijal at the hands of a Mughal musketeer.

Earlier that year, Rajaram made his 2nd attempt at the tomb of Akbar in Agra. The Jats took away the precious stones of the building, took away carpets, gold & silver vessels, lamps, etc. & damaged the building. Akbar’s bones were dragged out & thrown in the fire and burnt!
