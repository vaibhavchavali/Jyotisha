British East India Company's troops (3.9k, with 600 Europeans), together with raghunAth rAv's troops (few more thousands), forced to retreat from their attack by marATha-s under nAnA faDnavIs, were cut off at Vadgaon and forced to surrender. Excellent tactics (including scorched earth policy) were employed.

Unfortunately, nAnA faDnavIs, let the surrendered soldiers go. British Governor-General in Bengal, Warren Hastings, rejected the treaty; and marATha-s were again in trouble after the death of nAna.
