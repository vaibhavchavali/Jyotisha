Banda Bahadur, the vaiShNava disciple of Guru Gobind, crushed a mogol army. The Mughals were armed with artillery, well equipped cavalry and large infantry whereas the Sikhs had cavalry and infantry but no artillery. In the battle, his Sikhs gave a crushing blow to the Mughal empire. Wazir Khan (Sirhind) was killed in the battle and Sikhs established their first Raj in Punjab.
