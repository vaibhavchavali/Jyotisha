On this day, Brigadier Rajinder Singh, chief of kAshmIri Maharaja Hari Singh's army, died delaying pAkistani invaders before Indian army arrived.

## Context
On 22 October 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh gave his Chief of Army Staff, Brigadier Rajinder Singh, the order to defend the state until Indian troops arrived, that he should fight till death in doing so, "save the state till the last man and the last bullet". Doubtful of  Poonchie Muslim soldiers' loyalty, he set off with a few men and outdated weapons, fighting against numerically superior and better armed invaders. Destroying bridges and placing defensive positions while slowly retreating, he successfully delayed the enemy. The Brigadier's driver was killed so the Brigadier drove himself; however soon after he was also mortally wounded. The Brigadier ordered his men to continue ahead with the planned defensive strategy, and leave him where he was. Nothing more was heard of Brigadier Rajinder Singh. His men continued the fight until the next day, but nearly all were killed soon after. 

## Aftermath
The delay the Brigadier and his men caused the raiders, a delay of nearly 4 days, was enough for diplomatic decisions to be taken and for the Indian Army to arrive. For his rearguard last-stand actions, Brigadier Rajinder Singh is remembered as the "Saviour of Kashmir". Brigadier Rajinder's native hometown of Bagoona has been renamed as Rajinderpura.
