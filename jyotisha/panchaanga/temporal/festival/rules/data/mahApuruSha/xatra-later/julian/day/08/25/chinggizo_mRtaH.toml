On this, 12th day of the 7th Mongol lunar month, died the greatest of the military leaders of all times Chingiz Kha’Khan. Born Temujin, he literally rose from rags after his father was killed by Tatars, and was elected Kha’Khan in 1206 after being tied down in Mongolian tribal wars till age 40. He destroyed in a span of 21 years the hegemony of China and Islam, two of the most dangerous powers in human history. He proclaimed the sacred law (yasag) like father Manu. Most importantly, he became the most prolific progenitor of Central Asia.  He transcends cultural boundaries and had great impact on the world (including Hindus). He is considered to be of divine nature by Mongols.

## Events
At the brink of bringing about the collapse of the Tangut and Chin empires, while hunting an ibex the Khan fell from his horse, got likely got septicemia and died. His final words:

> “A jade stone is truly without crust,  
> polished dagger has no dirt on it,  
> a man born to life is not deathless,  
> he must go without home, without a resting placing. 
> 
> The glory of a deed is in its completion.  
> Firm and unbending is he who keeps a plighted word faithfully.  
> Follow not the will of another and good will of many will be yours.  

A funerary chant composed by Kiluken read: 

> O Lion of the great god Tengri, Boddhisatva on Earth, numerous clans of your Mongol nation are wailing for you.
