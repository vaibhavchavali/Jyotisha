Shortly after bAjI rAv 2's surrender to the British, and the British victory over shiNDe forces; yashvantrAv holkar separately (re)started his fight but settled for a treaty with the British.

He was initially successful, but was chased and defeated by General Lake - more by diplomacy than battle. The jAT rAjA raNajIt singh briefly helped, but defected when pressed. daulatrAv shiNDe joined briefly but was soon bought off. Other such as raNajIt singh of panjAb, hill chiefs, even the afhAn shAh etc.. all backed off and stayed away. 

He would write two years later to vyankojI bhosle: " I paid a visit to Daulatrao and explained to him how important it was for all of us to join to avert foreign domination. Daulatrao failed me. It was cooperation and good will which had built the Maratha state. But now, we have all become self seekers. You also did not make your promise good. It is no use now talking of past things. When I found myself abandoned on all sides, I accepted the offer the British agents brought to me and concluded the war."
