Shortly after the death of Mirza Raja Jai Singh of Amber, on this day, Awrangzeb issued issued a general order, for the demolition of temples and established schools of the Hindus throughout the empire and banning public worship. Soon after this the great Temple of Keshava Rai was destroyed (Jan.-Feb. 1670) and in its place a lofty mosque was erected. The idols, the author of Maasir-i-Alamgiri informs, were carried to Agra and buried under the steps of the mosque built by Begum Sahiba in order to be continually trodden upon, and the name of Mathura was changed to Islamabad.

## Translation of the order
The Lord Cherisher of the Faith learnt that in the provinces of Tatta, Multan and especially at Benares, the Brahman misbelievers used to teach their false books in their established schools, and that admirers and students both Hindu and Muslim used to come from great distances to these misguided men in order to acquire this vile learning. His Majesty, eager to establish Islam, issued orders to the governors of all the provinces to demolish the schools and temples of the infidels and with the utmost urgency put down the teaching and the public practice of the religion of these misbelievers.

Order issued on 8th April 1669 (Date converted to CE for convenience, Hijri Date 17 zilqad 1079 Hijri)
