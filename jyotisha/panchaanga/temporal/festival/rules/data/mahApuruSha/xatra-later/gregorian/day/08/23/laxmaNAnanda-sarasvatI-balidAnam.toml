Swami Lakshmanananda Saraswati and four of his disciples were murdered on 23 August 2008 ( Janmashtami Day) in his kanyA ashram, where he was rescuing and helping tribals who had been converted to Christianity. (A group of thirty to forty armed men surrounded the Ashram. Four of the assailants carried AK-47s and many others had locally made revolvers. Two of the four government provided security guards had gone home to eat, the assailants tied and gagged the two remaining guards.)

Hundreds of people gathered on the route to pay their last respects to Saraswati. Riots erupted when the procession passed through Christian localities. Nativist Kui tribals rose up and fought Maoist and Christian forces. Seven Christian tribals and one Maoist leader were convicted in the case. 

Saraswati received an anonymous threat only a week before his assassination. Ashram authorities also filed a First Information Report (or FIR) with the local police. However, no steps were taken to provide appropriate security cover to him, despite ample evidence that there were very real threats being made on his life and the lives of those he served.
