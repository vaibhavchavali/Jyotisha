Marathi translation (Satyen)

> बादशाहाने (औरंगजेब ) फर्मावले की सुईने त्याचे (छत्रपती संभाजी महाराजांचे) डोळे फोडून त्यात आंधळेपणाचं काजळ घालण्यात यावे. बादशहाच्या हुकुमाची अंमलबजावणी करण्यात आली.

> The Emperor after two days told Ruhullah Khan to learn from Sambha where he kept his treasure jewels and other property, and which of the (Imperial) commanders used to correspond with him. At this,..as is well-known, who-so-ever washed his hands of the hope speaks out whatever he has in his heart, spoke shameful and vain words in connection with His Majesty. The Khan without reporting plainly what the wretch had spoken, sent to His Majesty a line of it in the form of hints.
>
> The Emperor, therefore, ordered that by thrusting a needle they should give to his eyes the collyrium of blindness. It was done, as ordered. But that haughty man, in great pride gave up eating from that day, (1566) and inspite of the urging and pressing of his guards to eat, fasted for some days. At last the matter was reported to His Majesty. By his order Sambha was taken to the place of execution, his limbs were seperated one by one, and his head was taken round in show from Aurangabad to Burhanpur, and hung up on the gate at the capital Delhi.

> 16. In Second Ms. 5,000 on f. 143b.
> 17. Sambha was executed on Falgun (Chaitra) Vadi 30, 1745 V.S. Mon., 29 Jamad. A. 1100 A.H. i.e. March 12, 1689 A.D. Jedhe Shakavali, Shivaji., p. 32; M.A., (E.T.), p. 196.

## Per marATha accounts
Sambhaji was told that if he converted to Islam and spent his life as a servant of the emperor he could see life. Sambhaji made it clear that the Alamgir was the worst enemy of the country and the Padishaw was a real fool to follow a mentally ill person as his only prophet. Awrangzeb decided to execute him on hearing his reply. sambhAjI said he would sacrifice his life as an offering to the great mahAdeva. His tongue was cut out and fed to a dog. Then his eyes were gouged out and limbs cut. His heart was pulled out and finally the head was cut. Body parts which were left over from feeding dogs were then paraded through major cities in a procession.

## Background
Sambhaji's positions were spied upon by his own relations, the Shirke family, who had defected to the Mughals. Sambhaji and 25 of his advisors (including kavi kalash) were captured by the Mughal forces of Muqarrab Khan in a skirmish at Sangameshwar in February 1689. Earlier in his life he had escaped the clutches of Awrangzeb at Agra with his father shivAjI.
