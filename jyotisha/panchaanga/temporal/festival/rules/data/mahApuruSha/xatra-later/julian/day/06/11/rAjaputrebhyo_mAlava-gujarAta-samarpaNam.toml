As the neared mArvAr, Ajit Singh started negotiations after seeing the size of the Imperial army. Bahadur forced Ajit and Jai to march with him on his march to crush his brother's rebellion (he could not come back till June 1710.). But, they escaped - and allied with amar singh 2 of mevAr. Then they started fighting, gaining victory after victory. The Rajput Rajas had formed military ouposts at Rewari and Narnaul, 45 miles from Delhi and sent their armies towards Delhi, Rohtaka and Agra to harass the Mughals.

The rise of Banda Singh Bahadur and death of the faujdar of Sarhind further caused fear in the Mughal court.
