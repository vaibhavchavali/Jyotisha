On this day, shyAma prasAda mukharjI died under odd circustances under custody of Jammu and Kashmir government led by sheikh abdullah. 

He had gone there in support of Dogra Hindus who were being brutally suppressed for opposing the sheikh's declaration (tolerated by J Nehru in hopes of winning over the muslim population there), and said "Ek desh mein do Vidhan, do Pradhan aur Do Nishan nahi chalenge" (A single country can't have two constitutions, two prime ministers, and two national emblems). Strongly affected by the naokhali massacre of hindus by muslim league rioters, he had earlier opposed the idea of a united and undivided - but independent - bengal.

He was leader of Hindu mahAsabhA and founder of Bhartiya Jana Sangh.

Aftermath: The requirement for having ID cards for Indian citizens entering kAshmIr was removed. On 5 August 2019, long after congress days were over, Article 370 granting special status to kAshmIr was abrogated.
