en = """
Marathas took the Arnala island on the night of 6-7 April 1737.

Strategically, Arnala fort was very important for Marathas. Therefore, a Maratha force commanded by Shankaraji Phadke, Anjurkar, Bajirao Belose, Rayajirao Surve & 400 soldiers attacked Arnala fort.

## Impact
After that Marathas conquered small, but strategically important islands such as Parsik, Marol, Takmak fort, Santa Cruz, Tandulwadi, Saivan, Kaldurg fort, Kambe, Firangipada and Ghodbandar. This essentially further cut off the Portuguese support.
