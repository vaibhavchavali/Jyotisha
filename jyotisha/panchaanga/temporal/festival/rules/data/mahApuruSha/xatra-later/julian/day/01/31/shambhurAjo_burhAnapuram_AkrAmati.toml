Barely 15 days after being crowned in a grand ceremony at Raigad fort, Maratha army commanded by Sambhaji and Hambirrao Mohite attacked and plundered the city for three days. The Marathas got a huge loot (around 2 crore Rs) and returned to Raigad by evading Mughal forces.

Sambhaji had got the news that Bahadurkhan Kokaltash, the Subedar of Burhanpur was going to Aurangabad for his nephew's wedding with a girl Qutb Shah family. Bahadurkhan took a force 3,000 with him for the wedding. Hence Burhanpur was left with an army of 5,000 under Kakar Khan (in charge of collecting jizya tax). Sambhaji and his generals decided to further bifurcate the force at Burhanpur by feigning a move to attack Surat, forcing the Mughals at Burhanpur to send reinforcement to Surat, which had been sacked by Shivaji twice before.

Hambirrao Mohite reached the forests near Burhanpur with a 15,000 strong cavalry force. Kakar Khan gathered civilian forces and decided to attack Hambirrao at midnight. As he came out of the city gates, Sambhaji himself attacked from the old trenches with a cavalry force of 4,000. Sambhaji's force routed the ill-prepared Mughal garrison. Sambhaji then left 200-300 soldiers at the main city gate and left for Bahadurpura, the richest suburb of the city. Sambhaji started to loot the houses of the richest merchants which were shown to him by his spies. Hambirrao's force soon joined Sambhaji and the combined Maratha force started looting the city. Hambirrao then sealed the city's entrances to ensure that the word of the attack doesn't spread out. Marathas looted the city consecutively for three days.

Bahadurkhan hurried from Aurangabad with a large army and tried to recover the loot, but he was foiled by sambhAjI's tactics. Meanwhile, Suryaji Jakhde took advantage of this to briefly attack Aurangabad with a force of 7,000 via Paithan; and bahAdurkhAn had to return anyway. Some of Awrangzeb's elite Ahadi horsemen (stationed in every mogol city) tried to assassinate sambhAjI when he was visiting Saptashringi temple at vani on his way back - but failed.
