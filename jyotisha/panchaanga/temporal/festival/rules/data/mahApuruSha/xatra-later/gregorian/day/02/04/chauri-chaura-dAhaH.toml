The Chauri Chaura incident took place on 4 February 1922 at Chauri Chaura in the Gorakhpur district of the United Province (modern Uttar Pradesh) in British India, when a large group of protesters participating in the Non-cooperation movement, clashed with police who opened fire. In retaliation the demonstrators attacked and set fire to a police station, killing all of its occupants. The incident led to the death of three civilians and 22 policemen.

On Feb 2, agitators led by a retired Army soldier named Bhagwan Ahir, protested against high food prices and liquor sale in the marketplace. They had been arrested.

MK Gandhi, who was strictly against violence, halted the non-co-operation movement on the national level on 12 February 1922, as a direct result of this incident. 19 arrested demonstrators were sentenced to death and 110 to imprisonment for life by the British authorities.
