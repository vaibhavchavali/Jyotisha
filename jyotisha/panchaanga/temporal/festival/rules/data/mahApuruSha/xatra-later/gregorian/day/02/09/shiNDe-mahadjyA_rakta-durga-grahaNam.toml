Mahadji Scindia's sardar Balarao Govind entered the Red fort & took possession from Zabeta Khan's men, regaining control of Delhi after Panipat 1761.

After 1719, 1737, 1753-57, 1758-1761, the Marathas returned to Delhi and surrounded the city with their cannons on 8 February 1771. Mahadji Scindia, Ramchandra Ganesh, Visaji Krishna were the chiefs who were in the Maratha army. 'In the morning the Marathas having planted guns on all 4 sides, began to fire on the fort of Delhi...the ASAD BURJ was demolished. At noon negotiations began with Scindia's diwan..at sunset  the little gate of the fort was opened'.- Delhi Chronicle, 1771.

## Aftermath
Marathas obtained sanction from the puppet Mughal Badshah himself to pursue and purge the Rohilla Pashtun cream threatening North India. Marathas then began their rampage against Rohilla Pashtuns, cutting down all who were responsible for Panipat. Marathas led by Maharaja Mahadji Shinde drove out Rohillas & slaughtered them. Najib's tomb was bombarded & his bones were scattered all around. 

Najib's 10 year old grandson Qadir was discovered at Ghausgarh after his father Zabita fled and he was taken by Mughal Nazir Mansur. Gulām Qadir underwent a very gruesome fate. Ghulam Qadir was placed in Qudsia Bagh by Nazir Mansur & then castrated by Shah Alam II who turned Qadir into a catamite & abused him for years! Thus Najib's grandson literally became a bedmate of the Maratha puppet Shah Alam II!

Years later Ghulam Qadir invaded Delhi in order to get money to use against Marathas and looted over 25 Crores Rupees. He then avenged himself on his pederast Shah Alam II by conducting atrocities on the Mughal family. Marathas then pursued Qadir & tortured him slowly to death.
