On this day, the kotwal of puNe, ghAshIrAm Savaldas, a kAnyakubja brAhmaNa, was stoned to death by other brAhmaNa-s in vengence for the death of 21 tailanga brAhmaNas because of being locked up in a suffocating tunnel for an entire day and night.

## Context
Many brAhmaNas were in town for daxiNA. A curfew was in place, which some violated and allegedly indulged in rioting and unruly behavior. 35 were locked up. The prisoners remained in the cell for an entire day and a night and on the third morning, (an eminent chief named) Manaji Phakde (a cousin of Mahadji Sindia) was passing that way, when he heard noises. He then informed nAna of the tragedy.

Peshwa mAdhava rAv, who was just coming of age, summoned Nana and asked how ghAshIrAm should be punished. As news spread, over a thousand Brahmins gathered outside Nana’s house. Nana sent (the chief judge) Ayya Shastri to meet them, but he was assaulted and his clothes torn off. Nana ordered the arrest of the kotwal (who had by now earned a reputation for tyranny). Peshwa ordered him dead. He was taken out of town, let loose and left to the mercy of the Brahmins following the procession.
