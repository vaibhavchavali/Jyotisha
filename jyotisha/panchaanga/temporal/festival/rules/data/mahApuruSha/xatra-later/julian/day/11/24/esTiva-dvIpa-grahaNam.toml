On 24 November 1683 at night, when the tide was low, Sambhaji's full force attacked the unsuspecting fort and village on Santo Estêvão island. They captured the fort and plundered its village. A battalion of 200 men marched from mainland Goa in order to recapture the island. Seeing the size of the Maratha army, and the devastation caused by them, the battalion retreated to the capital City of Goa
