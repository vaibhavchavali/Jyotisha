On 12th August 1760, Khande Rao attacked Haidar at Srirangapatna but later let Haidar flee out of sentiment, with the promise that he would retire away from maisUru.

Date via Sinha referring to Selections from the Peshwa daftar vol 28.

## Events

> "Haidar in his messages (to Khande Rao) recognised the services of Kunde Row in all the success that had attended in his life; represented that without his counsel, he was helpless; and was now ready to be guided by his commands and deprecated in terms of the utmost humility his proceeding to extremities. 
> 
> That Kunde Row, in reply, acknowledged in his turn the benefits which he had received from Haidar; and disclaimed the intention of personal indignity; but stated that he was a servant of the Raja whose orders he should obey; that all he required from Haidar was to retire for ever from the service of Mysore, and on receiving his promise to that effect, he would withdraw the guards from the opposite side and advised him to escape that night; as on the morrow he would be compelled to act decisively against him". 
> 
> (Mark Wilks, vol 1, page 468) (Appendix VI). 

Wilks further observes 

> " I should hesitate to ascribe to Kunde Row the remnant of virtuous feeling which could dictate a conduct so politically imprudent if it were possible in any other manner to explain the known act, that Haidar found the ordinary landing place of the northern bank without a guard of any description". 

Next morning, Khande Rao captured the family members of Haidar including the young Tippu but treated them with respect.

## Context
- Khande Rao came in contact with Haidar Ali in August 1756 when the king entrusted him with 50k gold pieces to be given to Sahbas Sahib (brother of Haidar) and Haidar to enable them to raise an army to defeat the Dalawai brothers who had virtually imprisoned him (the king) in his own palace.
- Haidar rose to power under Khande Rao with the countenence of Karachuri Nanjarajaiah. In 1758, Khande Rao was made "Dewan" on the recommendation of Haidar and the Dalawais (including Karachuri Nanjarajaiah) were side-lined.
- By 1759, it was clear that Haidar was getting more and more revenue districts assigned to himself and Khande Rao had seen through Haidar's intention to fleece the king.
- The Wodeyar King sought the assistance of the Mahratta army and Khande Rao wrote several letters to George Pigout, Governor General at Madras for help.

## Aftermath
- Haidar escaped but did not keep his word. He went to Anekal and BengaLUru to regroup. Maratha troops attacked Haidar's forces on behalf of Khande Rao but Haidar managed to evade them. 
- Hyder moved towards shrIrangapaTTana but were defeated by Khande Rao's forces (16th December 1760). 
- Sadly, shortly thereafter marATha forces were recalled after the defeat at pANIpat. 
- Haidar rushed to the feet of the dalvai Karachuri Nanjarajaiah - the latter was swayed and basically let Haidar act on his behalf - sowing utter confusion in the maisUru king's troops. This ultimately led to the capture of khANDe rAv on 20th June 1761. khANDe rAv was put in an iron cage in bengaLUru, where he died next year.
