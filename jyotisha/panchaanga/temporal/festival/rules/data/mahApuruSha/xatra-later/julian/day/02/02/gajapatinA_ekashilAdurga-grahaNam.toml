Eldest son of Gajpati Kapileshvara - vIra-hamvIra-mahApatra and his nephew vIrabhadra-raghudeva-mahApatra (after likely taking on Khwaja-i-Jahan or Mahmud Gawan), captured the varangal fort. The Bahmani generals fled - and the governor and other soldiers were spared their lives.

### Context
Bahmanis had captured this fort from the Nayakas in 14th century. After rescuing the beseiged vellamA chief lingA-reDDi DevarakonDa and routing Bahmani Sultan's forces there, Hambira and Raghudeva proceeded to Warangal.

### raghunAtha's inscription
The characters of the inscription are Telugu. But the language is Oriya which is, however, considerably influenced by Sanskrit. There are many errors in the language and orthography of the record. The date, quoted in lines 2-5, is Saturday (Briha-vāsara), Mrigaśira-nakshatra, Magha-śu. 10, in the year Pramathin which is mentioned as corresponding to the Kali year 4861 current (i.e. Kali 4560 expired). Saturday, Magha-su. 10, Mrigasiru-nakshatra, in Kali 4561 current, corresponds regularly to the 2nd February, 1460 A.D.
