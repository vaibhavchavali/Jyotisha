[description]
en = "bAjIrAv, rANOjI shiNDe and mahlarrAv holkar defeated the Nizam Asaf Jah I. The peshvA (rather than give open battle) moved swiftly and looted nizam's ahmednagar area even as the nizAm was looting his lands. nizAm chased but could not keep up, while bAjI was always a step ahead thanks to his great spy network. Threatening ahmednagar, he drew the nizAm to a tight spot at pAlkheD with no supplies or access to water, cut off from artillery."
