maNi-rAm, aka bhAi maNi singh, a fine scholar and warrior, shiShya of the last 4 sikh gurus + bandA vairAgI, aged 94, was dismembered limb by limb.

Reason: Governor of Lahore, Zakaria Khan, expected Rs 5k in return for permission to celebrate divAlI at harmandir. But, knowing that he intended a slaughter (in collusion with divAn lakhpat rAi), the sikhs did not turn up - so maNi could not pay the money.
