[description]
en = "On his karnataka campaign, shivAjI, with deft dimplomacy aided by Qutb shAh's ministers madanna and akkanna enters bhAganagara and meets Qutb Shah. A dutch chronicler says: 'Both then sat down at seats prepared for them and entered into conversation. While they were thus talking, the palace was surrounded by 6,000 (Maratha) cavalry, who approached so silently, that the buzzing of a fly could have been heard. I do not speak from hearsay, for I was an eyewitness.' Thence he proceeded on his campaign, aided by Qutb Shahis. Another brAhmaNa named madanna pantalu was deputed by madanna to accompany shivAjI."
