British under General Lake defeated the marATha shiNDe army under ambAjI ingale after a fierce battle. The shiNDe army was sadly not joined by other powers, even marATha ones.

In the days leading up to the battle, Europeans employed by daulatrAv shiNDe to train and lead his army with new tactics treacherously defected to the British- especially the Frenchman Dudrenec and British officers like Smith and Larpent. The brave but less experienced / capable AmbajI had to fill in. Still, the marATha-s were advancing to Delhi before General Lake rushed and caught up.

> Letter by Gerard Lake at Camp Laswari, November 2, 1803 To the Governor General Marquis Wellesley:   
> "I sent you last night an account of our having at length completed the defeat of all the forces belonging to Perron or Scindiah on this side of India, which has been effected by great fatigue, difficulty and severe loss. These battalions were most uncommonly well appointed, had a most numerous artillery, as well served as they can possibly be, the gunners standing to their guns until killed by the bayonet. All the sepoys of the enemy behaved exceedingly well, and if they had been commanded by French officers, the event would have been, I fear, extremely doubtful. I never was in so severe a business in my life or anything like it and I pray to God I never may be in such a situation again"
