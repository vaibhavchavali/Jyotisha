On this day, Indian policemen employed by the British Raj fired on an unarmed crowd of 6k freedom protestors for 30 minutes. 29 persons including one woman named Pari Bewa, aged 65, died on the spot and 56 persons were mortally wounded.

Police contingent with 27 persons came. A boatman, Raj Jena, refused to ferry them in his boat at Chudamani ferry Ghat. They themselves ferried and proceeded into Iram, the headquarter of Swadhin Banchhanidhi Chakala. Having seen this, one Kusha Tarai, a boatman, began to blow conch shell as an alarm and swam the river and informed the leader at Iram. The conch blowing got itself repeated from village to village to indicate the arrival of the British forces. Soon a vast assemblage congregated at Iram melan ground as per the prior resolution of Swadhin Banchhanidhi Chakala, a parallel government of 19 square miles. As the chowkidars were carrying the kits of the troops through the meeting place, 2 of the persons named Mani Bej of Adhuan and Ratnakar Biswal of Suan intercepted and snatched away the luggage saying, “You can’t carry the belongings of the slaves of the Raj.” DSP Kunjabehari Mohanty and sub-Inspector Hema Panigrahi decided to fire. Bullets were distributed. In 30 minutes of firing, 304 rounds of 303 Mark VI ammunition had been fired into the crowd.

Context: The people of Iram had actively participated in the Non-cooperation Movement of 1920, the Civil Disobedience Movement of 1930, and the Quit India Movement of 1942 successively. Most of the leaders like Pt. Gopabandhu Dash, Dr. Harekrushna Mahatab, Pt. Nilakantha, Rama Devi, Md. Hanif, Poet Banchhanidhi Mohanty, and more freedom fighters made Iram a cauldron of revolution. The zamindar Late Radhakanta Parhi of Iram dispatched a letter secretly to the British employed DSP.
