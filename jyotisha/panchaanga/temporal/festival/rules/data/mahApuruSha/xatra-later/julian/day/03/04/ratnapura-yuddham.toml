Battle of Ratanpur (near Rajpipla,Gujarat): Marathas crushed Mughals in this battle, inspiring rebellion of Ajit Singh again. Durgadas Rathore left Mughals too (again)!

## Context
A letter was sent to the governor of Baroda that he should join the force that was being sent to Surat. These officers advanced as far as the Baba Piara (Bawapir) ford on the Narmada, where they remained encamped for a month and a half in inactivity and quarrels, merely sending out spies to ascertain where the Maratha army was located. At last, stern reproofs from Abdul Hamid Khan compelled them to cross the Narmada and to march forward until they reached the village of Ratanpur on the other side, where they pitched their camps at some distance from each other. Here their scattered armies were surprised by the great Maratha host and their raw levies were routed in two separate engagements. 

## Aftermath
Many of Mughal troops the were drowned in the Narbada in their flight, while those who escaped managed with difficulty to make their way to Broach. Safdar Khan Babi was wounded and taken prisoner while Nazar Ali Khan burned his tents and was forced to flee for his life.
