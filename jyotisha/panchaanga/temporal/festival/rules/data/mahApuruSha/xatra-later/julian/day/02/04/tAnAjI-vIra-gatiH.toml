tANAji mAlsure (aged over 70!) captured konDAna-durga, scaling the wall at night (using a trained monitor lizard called yashvantI according to legend) and sacrificed his life fighting Aurangzeb's servant udaya-bhAna-rAthoD. Overwhelmed attackers managed to capture the fort after they let further reinforcements in.

shivAjI exclaimed: "gaD Ala pan sinh gela" (The fort has been captured but we lost the lion). Fort was renamed simhagad in his honor.
