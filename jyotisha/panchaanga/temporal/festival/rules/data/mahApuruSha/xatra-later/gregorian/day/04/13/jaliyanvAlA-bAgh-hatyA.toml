On this day,  British Brigadier-General R. E. H. Dyer surrounded Jallianwala Bagh with his soldiers, blocked the exit, and fired at a crowd of unarmed crowd of baisAkhi celebrators plus pro-independence protestors. The troops kept on firing until their ammunition was exhausted (10 minutes, 1,650 rounds). At least 1000 people were killed and over 1,200 other people were injured of whom 192 were seriously injured. 120 bodies were recovered from a well in the grounds.

Dyer is reported to have, from time to time, "checked his fire and directed it upon places where the crowd was thickest". Some of the soldiers initially shot into the air, at which Dyer shouted: "Fire low. What have you been brought here for?".

The following day, Dyer issued the following notice:

> You people know well that I am a Sepoy and soldier. Do you want war or peace? If you wish for a war, the Government is prepared for it, and if you want peace, then obey my orders and open all your shops; else I will shoot. For me the battlefield of France or Amritsar is the same. I am a military man and I will go straight. ... I have served in the military for over 30 years. I understand the Indian Sepoy and Sikh people very well. You will have to obey my orders and observe peace. Otherwise the shops will be opened by force and rifles. You will have to report to me of the Badmash [criminals]. I will shoot them. Obey my orders and open shops. Speak up if you want war? You have committed a bad act in killing the English. The revenge will be taken upon you and upon your children.

## Aftermath
Michael O'Dwyer, Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab from 1913 to 1919, endorsed Dyer and called the massacre a "correct" action. O'Dwyer was assassinated in London in 1940 by Udham Singh.

Responses polarized both the British and Indian peoples. The army was retrained and developed less violent tactics for crowd control. Britain never formally apologised for the massacre but expressed "regret" in 2019.

Dyer was allowed to resign and settle in Britain. Huge funds were raised, including contributions by civil servants and Army officers and presented to the butcher; while families of the victims received Rs 500 (then equal to £37.10s.0d; equivalent to £1,497 in 2019) each after long delay. Dyer suffered a series of strokes during the last years of his life and he became increasingly isolated due to the paralysis and speechlessness inflicted by his strokes.
