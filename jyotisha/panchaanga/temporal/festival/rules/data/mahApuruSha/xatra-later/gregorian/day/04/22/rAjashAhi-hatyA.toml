Bangla muslim mobs attacked Hindus, motivated in part by Islamic Republic of Pakistan Army and government propaganda (including false stories about anti-muslim violence in India). An estimated 300 non-Muslims were killed in Rajshahi district alone. Around 11k Santhals and Rajbanshis migrated to India.

The intervention of the Indian Assistant High Commission resulted in the troops being called and the massacre was stopped.
