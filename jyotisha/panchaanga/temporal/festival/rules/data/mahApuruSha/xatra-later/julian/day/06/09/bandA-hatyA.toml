On this day, after three months of confinement, bandA bahAdur, the vaiShNava disciple of guru govindasiMha, was tortured and killed, after being captured and refusing to convert to Islam.

The execution was brutal. In the prior days, 100 sikh soldiers were brought out and killed daily. bandA was told to kill his four-year-old son, Ajai Singh, which he refused to do. So, Ajai Singh was murdered, his heart was cut out, and thrusted into Banda Bahdur's mouth. Later, banda's eyes were pulled out and his hands and feet chopped off. His flesh was torn with red hot pincers. Then he was beheaded. (Sources: Dispatches of John Surman and Edward Stephenson; and other witnesses)
