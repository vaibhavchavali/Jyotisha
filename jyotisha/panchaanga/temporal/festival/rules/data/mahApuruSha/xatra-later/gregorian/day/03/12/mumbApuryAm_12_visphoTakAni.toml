Mumbai, 13:30–15:40, Friday (between Ramadan Jumma prayers): 12 bombs exploded, 260 people dead, 700 + Injured. The RDX used came from Islamic Republic of Pakistan by sea, and was landed in Shekhadi and Porbandar by bribing customs officials. Indian muslim gangsters (connected with Dawood Ibrahim) were given arms, ammunition and explosives training in that Islamic Republic as well.

In 2006, 100 of 129 accused were found to be guilty and were convicted (including Yakub, Isa, Yusuf and Rubina Memon, who were punished). All of these death sentences were commuted to life sentences (except Yakub) by Supreme Court in 2013. Many convicted escaped custody, including a mastermind, Tiger Memon. The mastermind don, Dawood Ibrahim (from a Konkani muslim family), found refuge in Pakistan - where his daughter married notorious pAki cricketer Javed Miandad's son. 

On 10 July 2006, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Sharad Pawar, admitted that he had "deliberately misled" people following the 1993 Mumbai bombings by adding the name of a "13th" Muslim-dominated locality for "communal peace". He also admitted to lying about evidence recovered and misleading people into believing that it pointed to the Tamil Tigers as possible suspects.

Infuriated at the bombings, Ibrahim's right-hand man, Chotta Rajan, split from the organisation and took most of the leadership-level Hindu aides with him, including Sadhu, Jaspal Singh and Mohan Kotiyan. The ensuing war continued even 25 years later, involving 100s of deaths. 10+ accused (including Salim Kurla, Majeed Khan, Shakil Ahmed, Mohammed Jindran, Hanif Kadawala, Akbar Abu Sama Khan and Mohammed Latif) were assassinated by Rajan's hitmen. Chhota Rajan is believed to have assisted Indian intelligence agencies as well (while being targetted by pAkistan's ISI).
