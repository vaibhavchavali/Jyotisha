[description]
en = "Though their revolt seems to have been sparked off by a relatively insignificant incident, Aurangzeb's persecution of the Hindus was certainly the underlying cause which turned it into a religious uprising. The soldier hit the cultivator with a stick which broke his head, whereupon a body of Satnamis beat the assailant to death. When the news reached the local government administrator, he sent a party of footmen to arrest those men. By then a large number of Satnamis had gathered at the scene. They attacked the footmen, put them to flight and seized their arms. The number of rebels was increasing by the hour. The faujdar of Narnol sent a large body of horsemen and foot soldiers to punish the rebels. But they too were routed by the Satnamis. The movement now spread like wild fire and the number of rebels rose to some five thousand. The Satnamis defeated the faujdar of Narnol, captured the town, demolished a number of mosques and tombs and established their own administration. A belief spread among them that they were immortal and that if one of them was slain, seventy others would spring up in his place! At last, on 16th March 1672, Aurangzeb sent a force of 10,000 horsemen, supported by artillery, under command of Rad-andaz Khan to crush the revolt."
