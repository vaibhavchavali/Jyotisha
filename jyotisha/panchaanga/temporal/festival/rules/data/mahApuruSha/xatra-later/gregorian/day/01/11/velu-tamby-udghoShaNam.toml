Kundara Proclamation by Velu Thambi Dalawa, the Prime Minister/Diwan (Dalava) to King Balarama Varma of Travancore. It was an open call to arms, exhorting the common people to rise up against the British and to overthrow them. It said that he acted against british since he anticipated dishonour of Brahmin women, non observance of varnashrama, christian interference in temples & other adharma by british.

There was a massive response to his rallying call.

## Context
The Treaty signed with the British East India Company by the popular Maharajah Dharma Raja Rama Varma in 1795 was revised in what is known as the Treaty of 1805 (according to the English East India Company's policy of "Subordinate Isolation") after the insurrection of the Nair troops in Travancore. It increased the British Indian force stationed in Travancore and the amount of money to be paid as tribute to the British, though the expenditure of the State in maintaining its own standing army was drastically cut.

In spite of being fully aware of the financial crisis in Travancore, the Resident Col. Macaulay pressed Velu Thampi for immediate payment of the large amount of tribute and the expenses of putting down the mutiny of the Nair troops. The Maharajah meanwhile wrote to the Madras government for the recall of the Resident and appointment of a new Resident which was denied. The Dalawa was now disillusioned with the British whom he had considered a friend and who considered any "aggression on Travancore as an aggression on themselves" as per the previous treaties. The Dalawa also felt that the British were influencing the king to dismiss him.

In the neighbouring Kingdom of Cochin, Paliyath Govindan Achan, the powerful Dalawa of Cochin, was involved in feuds and had turned against the British. 

Velu Thampi Dalawa and the Paliath Achan, Govindan Menon, met and decided on the extirpation of the British Resident and end of British supremacy in their respective states. Dalawa Velu Thampi organised recruits, strengthened forts and stored up ammunition while similar preparations was made by the Paliath Achan in Cochin. 

## Aftermath
An insurrection followed, but was the British and allies won.  
The Dalawa had to commit suicide on exile later at Mannadi near Adoor.  
His statue is placed in front of Kerala Government Secretariat, Thiruvananthapuram.
