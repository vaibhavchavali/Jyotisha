On 13th November 1668 (in the same month as the raid on bArdesh, Goa), Shivaji commenced the construction of the temple of Shri Saptakoteshvara at Narwe.

Formerly the temple of Shri Saptakoteshvara, the family deity of the Kadamba dynasty that ruled over Goa in the 12th century, was in the village named Narwe (Naroa) in Divadi, a tiny coastal island. It was destroyed by the Muslims and the stone image of the deity was hidden by the devotees in the embankment of a field. 

When Goa came under the sway of Vijayanagar, Madhava, a minister of that Empire, built a new magnificent temple at the same place and reestablished the deity. This, too, was destroyed in 1540 – this time by the Portuguese - along with many other temples. They built a chapel dedicated to Nossa Senhora Candelaria in its place. 

Some remains of the ancient temple could still be noticed in the chapel. The image of the deity was smuggled out of Goa and a temple was built in another village within Adilshahi territory also named Narwe (Naroa) in the district of Dicholi, opposite the one in Divadi. This temple, it seems, was in a very dilapidated condition.

Shivaji was now building a new one at that site which he perhaps intended would serve as a beacon of hope for his Hindu brethren in Goa. This was all that he could do for them at the moment.
