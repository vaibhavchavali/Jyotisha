Major Mohit Sharma, SM (who'd earlier, in the guise of angry young Kashmiri Iftikaar Bhatt had infiltrated Hizbul Mujahideen, dramatically killed jihAdi commanders Abu Sabjar and Abu Torara and escaped), was leading Bravo Assault Team in operations in Kupwara District of North Kashmir. ... terrorists fired from three directions indiscriminately. In the heavy exchange of fire, four commandos were wounded immediately. With complete disregard to his safety, he crawled and recovered two soldiers to safety. Unmindful of the overwhelming fire, he threw grenades and killed two terrorists but was shot in the chest. In the brief respite that followed, he kept directing his commandos, in spite of serious injuries. Sensing further danger to his comrades, he charged in a daring close quarter combat killing two more terrorists. His last words to his 2nd in command was, "Make sure not one escapes the net."
