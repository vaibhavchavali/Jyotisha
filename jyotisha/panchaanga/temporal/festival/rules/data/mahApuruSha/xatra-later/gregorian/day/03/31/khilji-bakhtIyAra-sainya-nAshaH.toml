On this day, forces of the Assamese khen dynasty kAmarUpa king vishvasundara-deva aka pRthu utterly destroyed the army of the evil marauder Ikhtiyárud dín Muhammad Bakhtíyár Khiljí.

Kanaibadasibana or Kānāi Baraśi Bowā Rock Inscription of North Guwahati proclaims:

“śāke turaga-yugmeśe  
madhu-māsa-trayodaśe  
kāmarupaṁ samāgatya  
turuṣkāḥ kṣayamāyayuḥ”


## Context
Having utterly destroyed the world reknowned universities of nAlanda and vikramashIla (where the libraries are said to have burnt for days) besides massacring all Śramaṇas and Brāhmaṇas  during his 1200 invasion, having razed navadvIpa in his 1203/04 invasion of sena-ruled vanga, bakhtIyAr was seized by the ambition of seizing Tibet (likely attracted by plunder, trade routes and horses - a valuable military resource). 

Led on by a Mech convert named Ali, he with about 10k horses proceeded to cross a bridge in kAmarUpa. The kAmarUpa king sent him a message warning him about it being the wrong season (winter snow?) for attack and suggested that he wait till new year so the he would join in. But bakhtIyAr hurried on, leaving behind a few troops. After 15 days, he reached Tibet. There he began looting. Angry Tibetans inflicted heavy losses on bakhtIyAr. Further he feared arrival of a  massive army. So he began retreating.

The inhabitants of the valleys and passes had all removed far away from the road, and for a space of fifteen days, not a sir of food nor a blade of grass or fodder was to be found, and they were compelled to kill and eat their horses.

## Rout in kAmarUpa
By the time he got back to the bridge, he found it destroyed and the guard gone. He holed up in a temple. The kAmarUpa king pRthu ordered his troops to block their way out. Still, Bakhtíyár and forces escaped to the river bank, pursued by the kAmarUpa troops. They tried to ford the river in desperation. Almost everyone died. Out of 10k when they set out, about 100 made it accross.  

## Aftermath
Bakhtiyar fell into depression. Like his Delhi sultAn, he was soon murdered with a knife. kAmarUpa king pRthu continued to rule till 1228, when he died fighting Iltutmish’s son Nasiruddin.
