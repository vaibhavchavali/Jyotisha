On this day, shortly after the disaster at pAnIpat, the great mAdhavarAv became peshvA, with Raghunathrao (paternal uncle) as co-regent with Gopikabai, Madhavrao’s mother.

Madhavrao's Peshwaship lasted eleven years and four months, from 20 July 1761 to 18 November 1772, the first two years of which were a period of tutelage. During his last year he was entirely bed-ridden, so that it was only for about eight years that he actively controlled affairs. His activities may be arranged under four main heads, viz. :

- 1. His Karnataka expeditions for putting down Haidarali; 
- 2. His relations with Nizam Ali ;
- 3. His struggle first against his own uncle and then against the Bhosles of Nagpur ;
- 4. The revival of Maratha power in the north.
