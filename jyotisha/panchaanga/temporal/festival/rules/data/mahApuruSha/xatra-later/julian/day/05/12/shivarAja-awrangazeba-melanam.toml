shivAjI and sambhAjI were brought to the emperor by rAmasimha son of jayasiMha. They sent their nazar and nisAr gifts to awrangzeb. Everyone was given pAn from Awrang's receng birthday. Awrangzeb did not say anything to them. By this time, shivAjI was very angry and awrangzeb told rAm singh to find out what the matter was. shivAjI said: "You have seen, your father has seen, your Emperor has seen what a man I am, and yet you have deliberately kept me standing! I cast off your mansab. If you wanted me to stand, you should have done it with proper thought." Then he turned his back to the Emperor and immediately began to walk away. Whereupon Ram Sigh caught him by the hand, but Shivaji wrenched it away, came to one side and sat down. Ram Singh followed and tried to conciliate him. But Shivaji refused to listen and exclaimed: "... Cut off my head and take it there if you like; but I am not going into the Emperor's presence again." ... Awrang sent multafat, aqil and mukhlis khAns with a robe to conciliate him; but he still refused. Finally, Awrang told rAmasimha to take him to his residence and conciliate him. (As related by by jayasiMha's agent parkAldAs to kalyAndAs in a letter.)

It was well established Mogol custom that no one except the emperor and perhaps a crown prince were given a seat; and shivAjI knew it. But being made to stand below lackeys like jasvant singh. He was most angry with himself for agreeing to this abject visit in the first place. He had just agreed to the treaty and visit as expediency towards his goal of svarAjya, but this was too much. Awrangzeb saw him as a mere recalciterant rebel (mountain rat); while shivAjI knew he was far loftier than the average mogol nobleman.

In the coming days, shivAjI refused to go to Awrangzeb again, though he relented and sent his son to stand beside rAmasimha one day. rAmasiMha made excuses like "He has a fever".
