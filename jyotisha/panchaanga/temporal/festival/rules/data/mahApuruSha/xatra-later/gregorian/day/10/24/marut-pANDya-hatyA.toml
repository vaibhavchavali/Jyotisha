On this day, the British hung Periya and Chinna Marudhu pANDiyas of shivagangA, tamiL-nADu at Tiruppattur fort.

## Context
In 1772, Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah, (the Nawab of Arcot) had killed Muthuvaduganatha Thevar over his refusal to pay taxes. However Marudhu Pandiyars and Queen Velunachiyar escaped, and stayed with Gopala Nayak in Virupakshipuram for 8 years. After this time, an alliance of kingdoms led by the Pandiyar attacked Sivagangai and retook it in 1789. Both Maruthu Pandiyars were given high positions in the kingdom.

After 1781, British took over navAb of Arkot's finances, and then his army. Thence they went from strength to strength. The brothers participated in guerilla war against them. They ultimately captured and hung the marudu brothers.

## Aftermath
They are credited with inventing the Valari, a variant of the boomerang; and are honored by local tamils.
