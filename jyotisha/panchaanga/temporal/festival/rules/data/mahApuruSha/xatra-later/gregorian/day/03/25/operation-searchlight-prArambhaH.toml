Operation Searchlight, specially targetting Bengali Hindus and nationalists, began on this day. It marked the beginning of the genocide in bangladesh as well as the Bangla war of liberation. 


They put Mujibur Rahman behind bars and ambushed the Dhaka university, resulting in the death of 9 teachers and 200 students in Iqbal Hal. Similarly, the Pakistan army continued with its barbaric attacks on civilians in Old Dhaka, Tejgaon, Indira Road, Mirpur, Kalabagan and other places.

On the same night, several people in Chittagong were shot dead by army personnel. National newspapers, including, Daily Ittefaq, the Daily Sangbad were shut down and their offices were set ablaze, resulting in the death of several media personnel.

Mass graves were dug out and hastily bulldozed. An estimated 700 people were burnt to death in Dhaka. Similarly, they set fire to the houses of slum dwellers, fired bullets at those running away to save their lives, razed a Kali Mandir and also destroyed the Central Shaheed Minar.

## Aftermath
It is believed that around 10,000-35,000 Bengalis were killed by the Pakistan army under Operation Searchlight. In the months to follow, Pakistani military and supporting Islamist militias from Jamaat-e-Islami (lit. Collective of Islamists) killed up to 3 million people, raped between 200k and 400k Bengali women. A further eight to ten million people, mostly Hindus, fled to India.

Of course, the operation failed and backfired, as India under Indira Gandhi intervened and utterly defeated the Islamic republic's military in 14 days. Bangladesh has tried and hanged several war criminals. Pakistan continues to dispute the 1971 genocide.

Contemporary report by Ted Kennedy: 

> "Hardest hit have been members of the Hindu community who have been robbed of their lands and shops, systematically slaughtered, and in some places, painted with yellow patches marked H. All of this has been officially sanctioned, ordered and implemented under martial law from Islamabad".
