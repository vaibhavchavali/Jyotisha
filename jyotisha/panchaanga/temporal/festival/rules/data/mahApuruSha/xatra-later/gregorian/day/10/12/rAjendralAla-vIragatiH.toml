On this day, rAjendralAl, the president of the Noakhali Bar Association and the Noakhali District Hindu Mahasabha, died defending his home and family from Islamist mobs during the Noakhali riots.

On 11 October, the private army of Gholam Sarwar, known as the Miyar Fauz, attacked the residence of Rajendralal Roychowdhury. At that time Swami Tryambakananda of Bharat Sevashram Sangha was staying at their house as a guest. Roychowdhury fended off the mob from his terrace with his rifle for the entire day, while the Swami stood at the entrance with his khaDga. At nightfall, when they retreated, he sent the swami and his family members to safety. The next day the mob attacked again. Rajendralal Roychowdhury's severed head was presented to Golam Sarwar on a platter. While some notes claim that his two daughters were then kidnapped, actually they (Basanti and Reba) seem to have come to Kolkata as refugees. 

On 11 January 1947, the corpses of the Roychowdhurys were exhumed from a swamp in Azimpur and brought before Mahatma Gandhi's prayer assembly at Lamchar High School. After the prayers the corpses were cremated according to Hindu rites.
