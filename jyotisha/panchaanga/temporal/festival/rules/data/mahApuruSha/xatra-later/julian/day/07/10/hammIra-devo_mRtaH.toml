The accomplished hammIra deva chAhamAna of raNastambhapura (ranthambore) died at the young age of 28, after a long seige at raNastambhapura (ranthambore).

Initially it was Ulugh Khan from Bayana, and his general il-Ghazi Nusrat Khan from Qara - each with regiments of 40,000 Turkish cavalrymen and over 10,000 Kullar (slave/ convert/ castrato)  infantrymen with Arraadaas (trebuchets), gargachs (seige engines) and Manjiqs (mangonels) vs elite Rajput cavalry of 12,000 and 40,000 infantrymen with cross-bows, devices that spray fine red hot sand and burning oil. They wiped out the city of Jhain. hammIra beat them back.

Then Alla came forth with 90k cavalry and beseiged raNastambhapura. The nephews of the Rana, Kahnaiya and Bala Simha from Chittor cut through the cordon and brought some supplies and horses. Alla's efforts were initially futile. Alla then got a Buddhist traitor Sarjan Sah, who for a price, pointed out the location of the granary. Alla with giant trebuchets hurled rotting corpses and refuse into the granary to pollute it. Rajputs were left without viable food. The Rana’s queen Rangaa-Devi immolated herself with the other women. Wearing orange robes, the Rana, his younger brother Viram Deva, his teenaged nephews, his three commanders, Rai Ranadhira, Rai Gangadhara and Kshetra Singh Parmar and the four Mongol brothers with Kehbru at their head advanced to take on the Sultan. The battle is said to have raged so fierce that the Moslems lost 4000 men while the Rana’s troops were whittled down to just 200. The Rana’s horse was shot down and he continued fighting on foot. He placed his arrows in front of him on the ground and started shooting down the Moslem army. 

Context: HammIra was a fine ruler, fighter as well as a medical scholar (authoring sadyogamuktAvalI)! khalji ruler Alla-ud-dIn, having murdered jalAl-ud-dIn, decided to exterminate chauhans. Hammira Deva had given refuge to mongol rivals of the khalji turks as well. Ulugh Khan sent a message to the Rana to humbly accept Islam and hand over the Mongol chiefs whom he had sheltered. 

Aftermath:  
- Hammira is celebrated as a hero in several texts composed after his death including Nayachandra Suri's Hammira Mahakavya, Jodharaja's Hammira-Raso, and Chandrashekhara's Hammira-Hatha.  
- The Turks captured the Mongol Alaghu and Alla offered him the post of a general. Alaghu said he was not willing to serve a lowly Khalji, whose tribesmen were once Naukers of Chingiz Kha’Khan. Alla had Alaghu crushed under an elephant and his head was exhibited in Delhi as a trophy.
- The Buddhist traitor Sarjan Sah, hoped a lavish reward from the Sultan, but he was instead clubbed to death.
- The City of Ranthambhor was blotted out and the Sultan devastated all the temples in the region. Thus ended the power of the Chahamanas in Hindustan. The library of saMskRta works at Ranthambhor was burnt down by the jihAdists; whatever material could be salvaged was collated several years later as a collection of maxims and poetic sketches by Sharngadhara the grandson of Raghavadeva the Brahmin prime minister of Hammira Deva.

    हम्मीरन् तं चाहमानं नमामः॥
