bAjI-rAv rescues kAnhojI Angre and pressures the Portuguese and British into a treaty.

Context: English and the Portuguese joined forces and tried to down kAnhojI angre for a few years. Even Chhatrapati Shahu and Chhatrapati Sambhaji of Kolhapur vied to control him. Finally, kAnhojI was desperate. On  30 December 1720, Bajirao stationed 7,000 cavalry at Alibag for the protection of the town. On 1 January 1720 Bajirao informed the Portuguese that he was the Prime Minister of  Chhatrapati Shahu and that in that capacity he was in Alibag to get Kanhoji Angria to  acknowledge the paramountcy of the Chhatrapati to which Kanhoji had agreed. Knowing that he would be helpless  before the Mahratta forces, the Viceroy agreed to enter into a treaty.
