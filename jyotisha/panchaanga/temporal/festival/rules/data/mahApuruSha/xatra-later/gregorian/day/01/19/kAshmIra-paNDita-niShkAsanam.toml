This day marks paNDit exodus day.  Merits reflection by people of all religions.

Ethnic cleansing of Kashmir's Hindus began. Didn't stop until  300k–600k were  chased, killed and their properties looted or destroyed by their "peaceful" neighbours & even friends. Many Kashmiri Hindu women were kidnapped, gang-raped and murdered (eg. by beating, cutting with a saw), throughout the time of exodus. 

## Context
It was preceded by slaughter of 300 Hindu men and women, nearly all of them Kashmiri Pandits since the brutal murder of Pandit Tika Lal Taploo, newspaper messages (eg Aftab Jan 4) threatening all Hindus to leave, posters threatening kAshmIris to follow Islamic rules, coloring shops green. 

## Events
At midnight (beginning of 19th), a blackout took place in the Kashmir Valley where electricity was cut except in mosques. Throughout the day, Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front and Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists used public address systems at mosques to exhort people to defy curfew and take to the streets. Masked men, firing guns, marched about, terrorizing cowering Pandits who, by then, had locked themselves in their homes.  Three taped slogans are repeatedly played the whole night from mosques: 'Kashmir mei agar rehna hai, Allah-O-Akbar kehna hai' (If you want to stay in Kashmir, you have to say Allah-O-Akbar); 'Yahan kya chalega, Nizam-e-Mustafa' (What do we want here? Rule of Shariah); 'Asi gachchi Pakistan, baTao roas te baTanev san' (We want Pakistan along with Hindu women but without their men).

## Aftermath
### 1990 killings
- 19 Jan. Chuni Lal Shala, inspector, had grown a beard and was visiting Sopore with a Muslim Constable. The constable identified him, called two terrorists seeking him back - and then according to one account - joined them beating him to death. 
- On 25 January 1990, Rawalpora shooting incident took place, wherein four Indian Air Force personnel were killed and 10 others were injured. 
- On 2 February 1990, Satish Tikoo murdered near his own house in Habba Kadal, Srinagar.
- On 12 February 1990, Tej Krishen Razdan was killed by a muslim colleague (shot, kicked, displayed in a mosque).
- On 13 February 1990, Lassa Kaul, Station Director of Srinagar Doordarshan, was shot dead.
- 24 Feb - Ashok Kumar Qazi - shot in knuckles; murderers danced around him, pulled his hair out, slapped, spat, urinated, finally finished him and ran away. 
- 27 Feb - Navin saproo. Killers followed with glee the police van with which relatives picked up his body right to the cremation ground.
- 22 March - PN Kaul - skinned alive. 
- 22 March - BK Ganjoo was hiding in a rice bin. Muslim neighbors called the jihAdis back and ratted him out. While leaving, they shouted, "Let your blood be soaked in the rice and let your children eat it. Ah, what a tasty meal it would be".
- 28 April - Bhushan Lal Raina killed. Ignoring his mother's pleas, with a sharp pointed iron rod, they pierced his skull. They dragged him out and nailed him to a tree after stripping off his clothes. They killed him by inches while he begged to be shot.
- On 29/30 April 1990, Sarwanand Kaul Premi, an old Kashmiri poet (who kept a rare Quran manuscript in his home shrine as well) made to carry loot from his home. His son accaompanied him. The place in between the eyebrows, where Premi used to apply "Tilak", was found pierced by an iron and skin peeled off. The entire body bore the marks of cigarette burns. The limbs were found broken and eyes of both father and the son gouged out. They were later hanged and to be doubly sure shot too.
- May 7, Prof and Ms K. L. Ganjoo - terrorists shot him and threw him into the Jhelum to die. Nephew was given a choice-either to jump into the river to which his uncle had been consigned or watch what they were going to do with his aunt. The boy jumped into the river - and survived (despite not being a swimmer).
- May 20, Chaman Lal Pandita kidnapped and strangled. Neighbours had promised protection and stopped him from leaving.
- June 24, Ashwani Kumar Garyali shot, knees broken, left to die. Police refused to send a vehicle to send him to a hospital.

My bua was then thrown into a taxi, with 5 men (one of them being her colleague), who tortured her, raped her, and then brutally murdered her by cutting her alive with a carpenter saw." (Note: Manual saw, not mechanical saw.)
