It was AshADha k1 (as per jedhe shAkhAvali). bAji prabhu deshpANDe (a kAyastha) leading ~300 men died holding back Adil-shAhi african general siddi masud's 10k soldiers in a narrow pass while shivAji leading his 300 escaped from panhaLa fort to the beseiged vishAlgad fort (some say he sent out a decoy - Shiva Kashid- as well). 

bAjI prabhu bought him time to escape, holding back the pursuing enemy (under Jauhar's son Siddi Aziz and Afzal Khan's son Fazl Khan) at the gajapur pass (aka ghoD-khiND, later renamed pAvana-khiND to recall bAhI-prabhu's sacrifice). shivAjI, after fighting fiercely (supposedly holding daNDapaTTa swords in both hands) at vishAlgaD surroundings for 5 hours, announced his safe entry into vishAlgaD with cannon-fire. It is said that bAjI only then died with relief.  

PS: vishAlgad was already under siege by Bijapuri sardars under siddi jauhar - Suryarao Surve and Jaswantrao Dalvi. But shivAjI's posse, assisted by that of the brAhmaNa chief rango nArAyaN (attacking from Gonimooth hill), relieved the defenders and routed the attackers upon arrival. It's a thrilling tale, akin to tale of the spartans holding back the persians at the narrow pass at Thermopylae.

Aftermath:  
- bAjI prabhu and most of his men died. Other casualities included his brother Fulaji Prabhu and Shambusing Jadhav. On the sultan's side - 1k to 5k died in both actions.
- Shivaji then safely crossed the western ghats and reached his capital Rajgad via Konkan region.
- Shivaji later personally visited the house of the slain Baji Prabhu and honored and helped his family. It is said that Shivaji’s mother, Jijabai, wept at the news of Baji Prabhu’s death.
