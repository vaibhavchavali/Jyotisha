On this day, in the first battle on the neDuMkoTa coast-to-mountain fortification, Tipu Sultan and troops were routed. Tipu was wounded (physically and mentally), and lost 1k troops. padmanAbhapura lost 300. Several of Tipu's officers (including Europeans) were captured.

Two horses were shot from under Tipu, and he even got an arrow in the back. During the hasty retreat, Tipu fell back into the ditch twice before being helped out and the occasional lameness which he suffered until his death was reputedly the consequence. Tipu's sword, the palanquin, the dagger, the ring and many other personal effects fell into the ditch, and then into the hands of the minister keshava-dAsa.


## Aftermath
Humiliated Tipu vowed to take down "the contemptible wall". The fine wall held up till 15th April. Then he managed a 1km wide breach after 1 month of sustained artillery fire and poured in - only to be foiled again at Alwaye river bank. He retreated by 24 May 1790 to defend his kingdom from British threat.

## Context
The Dutch captive-turned general of padmanAbhapura's mArtANDa varma, De Lannoy, had built an excellent fortification from coast to mountain - neDuMkoTa. It had a 16 feet wide and 20 deep ditch. dharmarAja rAma varma had tried to get British help when Tipu's attack was imminent, but only got words. The Dutch, who'd sold forts to rAma varma helped a bit - by sending an engineer von Krause, who was dispatched to the wall. He wrote an account of the battle.

When Tipu attacked, he tried filling a small portion of the ditch with cotton sacks and moving in a small column via a narrow passage. At first the Mysoreans overpowered three batteries of the Lines but subsequently their flanks were subjected to fire from the woods. They were so surprised by the first round of fire that they fell into disorder. Then the well drilled nair army advanced and the confusion increased. Those Mysoreans who had not yet been trampled down by their horses while retreating found that the sacks with cotton, used for filling up the ditch when they set out, as well as some powder-barrels, had caught fire. This forced them to jump from the ramparts.
