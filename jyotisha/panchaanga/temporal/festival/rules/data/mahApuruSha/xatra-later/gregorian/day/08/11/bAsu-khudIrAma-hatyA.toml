On this day at 6 AM, 18.5 year old freedom fighter khudIrAm bose, walked firmly and cheerfully to the gallows.

## Aftermath
After the hanging, the funeral procession went through the city, with police guards holding back the crowd all along the central artery street. The people kept throwing their flowers on the body as the carriage passed by.

The actions of khudIrAm and Prafulla were defended by many nationalists (including BG Tilak, who was promptly arrested on sedition charges). 

After martyrdom, Khudiram became so popular that weavers of Bengal started weaving a special type of dhoti, with 'Khudiram' written on its side. Boys studying in school colleges wore these dhotis and stitched and walked on the path of independence.

## Context
khudIrAm and Prafulla Chaki had tried to assassinate the notorious British judge Douglas Kingsford - but their bomb ended up killing two British women instead.

He had been arrested by constables Fateh Singh, and Shiv prasAd Singh near the Waini railway station (now named after him). On 1 May, he was brought to Muzaffarpur by train - a crowd awaited to see him - he cheerfully cried 'vandE mAtaram'. Narendrakumar Basu had came to Khudiram's defence and mounted a very strong case in his defence (redirecting the main blame to the older prafulla and invalidating khudIrAm's initial statement), but failed.

When he was sentenced to death, his spontaneous reaction was to smile. The judge, surprised, asked Khudiram whether he had understood the meaning of the pronounced sentence. Khudiram replied that he surely had. When the judge asked him again whether he had anything to say, in front of a packed audience, Khudiram replied with the same smile that if he could be given some time, he could teach the judge the skill of bomb-making. Khudiram refused to appeal - but was persuaded to go along by the defence team. 

## Influences and early activities
In 1902 and 1903, Sri Aurobindo and Sister Nivedita visited Midnapore. They held a series of public lectures and private session with the existing revolutionary groups for freedom. Khudiram, a teenager, was an active participant in the discussions about the revolution. He joined Anushilan Samiti, and came into contact with the network of Barindra Kumar Ghosh of Calcutta. He became a volunteer at the age of 15, and was arrested for distributing pamphlets against the British rule in India.
