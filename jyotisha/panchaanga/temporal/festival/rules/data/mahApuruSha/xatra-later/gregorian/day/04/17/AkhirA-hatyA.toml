In April 1971, a member of the Razakar forces, Kenan Uddin Sarkar of Ramchandrapur village under Parbatipur sub-division of Dinajpur district, assured 50 Hindu families of neighbouring Badarganj, Kholahati, Birampur, Aftabganj and Sherpur of a safe passage to India. He kept the Hindus confined at a place called Baraihat in present-day Phulbari Upazila. The Razakars and the Al-Badr militia looted the money and jewelry from Hindus during their confinement. After that another Razakar, an associate of Kenan Uddin Sarkar informed the Pakistani army. The Pakistani army took the hostage Hindus to Akhira, 100 metres from south of Baraihat. It was about 11 A.M. The Hindus were made to stand in a row beside a pond, the men in one line and the women and children in another. They were burst fired from machine guns. A few children and teenagers who were survived the burst fire, were bayonetted to death. According to eye witness accounts, after gunning down the men, the Pakistani soldiers turned their attention to the females, and brutally gang raped them at that spot.
