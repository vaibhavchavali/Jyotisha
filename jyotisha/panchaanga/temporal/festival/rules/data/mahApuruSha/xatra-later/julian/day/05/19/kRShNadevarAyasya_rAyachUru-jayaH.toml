Krishnadeva Raya of Vijayanagar routed the Bijapur army of Ismail Adil Shah which had come to save Raichur fort (beseiged since around March) and captured it.

Ismail hoped that his artillery would decimate Vijayanagara attackers - but Krishnadevaraya only sent a division under kumAra vijaya for a vigorous attack. As the bijApur vanguard retreated, the artillery opened fire forcing kumAra vijaya's forces to retreat - pursued by bijApur forces. At that time, the rAya joined with the rest of his army crushing the pursuers. bijApur army fled - many drowned in the kRShNA river at their rear. Salabat Khan tried to stop the rout, but his band of 500 portuguese mercenaries were eliminated and Salabat captured as they almost reached the rAya's guard. Adil Shah, who did not fight at all, ran away on an elephant with 500 horse. Horse trader Christovao de Figueiredo then offered services of his band of 20 - they picked off fort defenders (including the governor) using their arquebusses. After that the fort was captured.  

Context:  Vijayanagara had captured rAyachUru earlier in 1510, but they'd lost it in 1516 while busy fighting gajapati-s. Krishnadevaraya, aged 35, sent Seyed Maraikar, a Muslim in his service, to Goa with 40k gold coins to buy horses. Maraikar betrayed Krishnadevaraya's cause and went to Ismail Adil Shah with the money and offered his services. Krishnadevaraya made a demand that Maraikar be returned along with the money. Ismail refused and instead helped him escape to Goa. During the period of peace Krishnadevaraya made extensive preparations for a grand attack on Raichur Doab. After the court decided that Raichur should be attacked, the king invited all commanders (Nayakas) in his service to take part in the battle.

Aftermath: Nizam Shah, Qutb Shah, Barid Shah and Imad Shah wrote to the rAya asking him to return rAyachUru or that they would combine against him. The rAya replied that they should not trouble themselves - he would visit them. Ismail dallied until the rAya marched on to bijApur itself (1523). Sadly, just 7 years later, aged 45, kRShNadevarAya died even as he planned to capture beLgaum.
