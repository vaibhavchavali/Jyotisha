On this day, mAdhavarAv decimated the nizam's army on godAvarI banks.

Aftermath: Madhavrao proved his military acumen & courage through timely troop movements before, & during the battle. In stark contrast, Raghunathrao was seen as indecisive, & Madhavrao was made Peshwa again! Nana Fadnavis was restored to office, with his brother Moropant Phadnis too. Peshwa Madhavrao met Mahadji Shinde to confirm services.


Context: While the peshvA was in a southern campaign, the Nizam (allied with Janoji Bhosale of nAgpur and Chatrapati rAmarAja of kolhApur) decided to attack, as planned by his divAn viTThala-sundara. For a change, raghunAtharAv joined mAdhavarAv. With a carrot and stick policy, jAnojI secretly returned to the peshva camp. Marathas started deserting the Nizam. mAdhavarAv had sped north and decimated the nizAm's army on godAvarI banks.
