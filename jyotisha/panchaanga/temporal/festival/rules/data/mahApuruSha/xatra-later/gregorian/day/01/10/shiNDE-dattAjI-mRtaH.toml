10 Jan 1760 will be remembered for the defence of Delhi by an outnumbered Maratha army from the Afghan armies of  Ahmed Shah Abdali & Najib Khan Rohilla. Dattaji Scindia laid down his life at Burari ghat Delhi. (Earlier, Ahmad Shah Durrani on his fifth invasion was defeated by the Marathas in the Battle of Lahore (1759).) 

Dattaji fought very bravely. At last, he was severely wounded and collapsed on the battleground. Najib Khan Rohilla’s adviser Qutub Shah stepped down from his elephant and came towards Dattaji. He asked Dattaji, ‘क्यों पटेलजी, हमारे साथ तुम और भी लढेंगे?’ Dattaji was in a wounded state. But after hearing these words of Qutub Shah, he replied with pride, ‘हाँ, बचेंगे तो और भी लढेंगे।’ At this Qutb Shah beheaded him. (In vengence, in October 1760, Qutub Shah's severed head would be paraded.)

The tale of how Dattaji, Jayaji Scindia, Malharrao Holkar came close to renovating Kashi temple but then failed is interesting. The trio sent a msg to Kashi Pandits in 1750 that they were coming to renovate the temple. However, the Pandits refused due to Muslim fear
