Aurangzeb wished to annex Marwar on this opportunity; however Durgadas Rathore wanted the infant son of Jaswant Singh, Ajit Singh to be the successor. Aurangzeb agreed to make him successor only if he was raised in Mughal harem, & converts to Islam. Durgadas asked Aurangzeb to let Ajit Singh be presented to Mughal court only after he comes of age. Not agreeing, Aurangzeb tried to imprison Durgadas Rathore alongwith infant Ajit Singh & the 2 queens of Jaswant Singh.
