en = """ On Shivaratri day, Feb 8th 1727, Siddi sAt, launched a Jihad to attack the Rama temple on the Chiplun hill (when brahmendra svAmI was absent).  
Having desecrated the idols he rounded up several hundred brAhmaNas, tortured them and killed many of them. 

## Context
Svami Brahmendra had built a large temple of the bhArgava on hill near
Chiplun, which was lavishly endowed by the Hindus of the Maharatta
country.  
At this time the Siddi governor of Govalkot and Anjanvel, two fortified posts not far from the shrine, was one Siddi Sat, a competent, if rather rough, officer.  
In 1727, the Siddi admiral, Siddi sAt, launched a naval raid on
the adjacent territory of Govalkot and Anjanvel, annexed them and
fortified them for an offensive on the Hindus. The African imitator of
his Arab role-models was seized with an itch to become a Ghazi and be
recognized as a pre-eminent Moslem. 

This attack enraged the Hindus
who called upon Shahu to take the strongest action.

## Aftermath
(The below is from New History of Marathas v2 by sArdesai.)  
This wanton and certainly premeditated violence by a Muslim on a centre of Brahman orthodoxy, roused the whole of Maharashtra as if from a dream, and a cry for vengeance arose on all sides. The chief ruler of Janjira at once apologized for the foolish action of his subordinate, and restored whatever property was left intact. 

In a few days the Swami arrived on the spot, vented his wrath against the Siddi and left the place for good, having been granted another spot by Shahu up the Ghats at Dhavadsi near Satara, where he then erected new edifices and where an annual celebration for his deity is still held. 

The Swami appealed pathetically to Shahu and the icading Maratha commanders, calling upon then to wage a relentless holy war against the Siddi of Janjira. Time passed as no one was free to undertake the venture. When Bajirao returned victorious from his campaign of Dabhoi, both Shahu and the Swami became insistent on his punishing the Siddi for the unwarrantable crime he had committed.
