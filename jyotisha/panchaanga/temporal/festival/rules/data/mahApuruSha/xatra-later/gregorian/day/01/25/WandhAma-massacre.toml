In an attack (allegedly by  Abdul Hamid Gada of Hizbul Mujahideen = 'Party of Holy Fighters'), timed to coincide with the Shab-e-Qadar, the holiest night of Ramadan, 26 Kashmiri Hindus living in the village of Wandhama were slaughtered. 

The gunmen came to their house dressed like Indian Army soldiers, had tea with them, waiting for a radio message indicating that all Hindu families in the village had been covered, lined them up and shot them dead.

## Aftermath
Politicians expressed "kaDhI nindA". PM Gujral flew to Kashmir for national winter games at Gulmarg. He inaugurated sports carnival on 28 Jan when smoke & ashes of funeral pyres were still in air.

Gada was subsequently killed in an operation by Indian security forces in 2000.
