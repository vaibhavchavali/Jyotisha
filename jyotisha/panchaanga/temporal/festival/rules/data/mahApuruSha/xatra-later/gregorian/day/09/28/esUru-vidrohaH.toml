On September 28, 1942, the residents of Esuru refused to pay tax to the British government. Expecting a backlash, they prepared to face the British. They put up a board reading, ‘Swaraj Sarkar’ and hoisted the tricolour. When British officials tried to enter Esuru, there was a ‘riot’ which led to the death of a revenue officer Chennakrishnaiah and a revenue ‘amaldar’ (Kenche Gowda?). 

## Aftermath
- British government sent police troops to reclaim the village.
- Anticipating the trouble, villagers fenced all the roads leading to Esuru.
- All freedom fighters took shelter in a nearby forest, leaving the children, women and elders in the village. Empty streets greeted the British forces. Frustrated British jawans were violent with the remainder.
- Five youth were hanged and hundreds were imprisoned. 
- After Independence, all of them were released and a grand reception was given to them by the people of Shivamogga.
