On this day, Indigenous Christian Fijians led by Sitiveni Rabuka effected a military coup (their second that year), tore up the constitution, discarded multi-ethnic governments and compromises, triggering exodus of Indian origin Fijians from the Island.

## Context
- Tensions between indigenous (mostly Methodist Christian) Fijian and (majority Hindu) Indo-Fijian ethnic groups (comprising an estimated 46% and 49% of the 1987 population, respectively) were high. The former were additionally supported by the Church and the native Chiefs.
- The Indians had come to neglect participation in the Army for many decades (Their demanding equal pay as Euroeans during WW2 caused the British to disband the Indian platoon).
- Also, Indian Total Fertility Rate (which was initially higher than the natives) had fallen.

## Aftermath
- A new constitution was ratified in 1990, in which the offices of President and Prime Minister, along with two-thirds of the Senate and a substantial majority of the House of Representatives, were reserved for indigenous Fijians. These racially discriminatory provisions were eventually overturned by a constitutional revision in 1997.
- The coups triggered much emigration by Indo-Fijians (particularly skilled workers), making them a minority by 1994. 
- Fiji's economy contracted by as much as 7.8% between 1987 and 1988, due to a major downturn in tourism and sugar production.
- Further coups happened in 2000-s.
