On this day, a dejected Dutch force, led by Captain Daniel Bergen and Jacob Hinderman, abandoned the Kilimanoor fort - leaving behind ammunition and provisions, diplomatically outmaneouvred by the padmanAbhapura army of mArtANDa varma and abandoned by their erstwhile allies - the rulers of Kollam and Kayamkulam.

The Dutch force retreated to AyirUr, where they were surrounded - but were rescued by ships sent by the malabAr command.

## Context
The Dutch had recently lost badly at Colachel. Peace negotiations (conducted in anticipation of Dutch reinforcements under van Imhoff) had failed.

## Aftermath
mArtANDa varma's forces attacked Kollam (defended by soldiers led by achyuta vArriar) in June. Dutch tried to help, but couldn't. The ruler of Kollam and Kayamkulam agreed to become a tributary of padmanAbhapura, signed a treaty to this effect in September 1742, at Mannar, ceded much territory and paid annual tribute. Further attempts by him to renege with Dutch help were fruitless.

mArtANDa-varma dragged on negotiations with Dutch - ultimately backing out by presenting strict terms as soon as he learned that van Imhoff had not yet departed from Europe - eventually leading to Dutch capitulation.
