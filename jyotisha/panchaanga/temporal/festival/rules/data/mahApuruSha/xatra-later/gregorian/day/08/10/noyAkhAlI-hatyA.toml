The massacre of the Hindu population in Noakhali started on 10 October, on the day of Kojagari Lakshmi Puja.  It is estimated that 5,000 were killed, hundreds of Hindu women were raped and thousands of Hindu men and women were forcibly converted to Islam. Around 50,000 to 75,000 survivors were sheltered in temporary relief camps in Comilla, Chandpur, Agartala and other places. Around 50,000 Hindus remained marooned in the affected areas under the strict surveillance of the Muslims, where the administration had no say. According to Dinesh Chandra, Hindus were forced to pay subscriptions to the Muslim League and jiziyah.
