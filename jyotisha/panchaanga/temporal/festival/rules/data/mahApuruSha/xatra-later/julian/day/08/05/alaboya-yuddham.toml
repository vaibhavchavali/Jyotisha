Mogol forces under rAma siMha (son of jayasiMha) of Amber defeat Ahom forces under Lachit Borphukan in a forced challenge. 10k Ahom soldiers were killed. This would be reversed a few years later in the Battle of Saraighat, two years later, in 1671 CE.

Background:
A few years after shivAjI's escape, rAmasiMha was sent by Awrangzeb to capture assam. His efforts at psychological warfare and dissent bore fruit when King Chakradhwaja Singha gave Lachit Borphukan and his commanders an ultimatum to attack mogols the very next day. Lachit was bewildered - charging the superior Rajput cavalry would be suicidal and that a naval engagement with the Mughals would be more feasible.

Lachit Borphukan had accepted rAmasiMha's challenge and prepared a force of 40,000 men under four commanders. However, he led Ram Singh to believe that the Ahom army was only 20,000-strong. So the Rajput king sent only 10,000 soldiers under the command of Mir Nawab and madanavatI. Madanavati’s carnage on horseback only ended after she was shot dead by a stray bullet. Lachit's hidden reserves then turned the tide. rAmasiMha became angry and then sent in the entire Rajput cavalry along with Mughal veterans who had been standing by.
