On 2 May 2003, in the early evening, eight Hindus were hacked to death by a Muslim mob on the Marad beach in Kerala after reeling in their catch for the day. One attacker, Mohammed Ashker, was hit by accident and was also killed. The attackers also threw bombs with the intention of inflicting more deaths, but the bombs did not explode.

## Background
On 3 and 4 January 2002 at Marad, three Hindus and two Muslims were killed in a sudden breach of peace due to scuffles between two groups that began as a trivial altercation over drinking water at the public tap.

## Aftermath
Later, police unearthed a huge cache of weapons including 17 bombs. The police commissioner, TK Vinod Kumar stated: "It was an operation carried out by a well-knit organization. It was a quick and sudden attack which was over in 10 minutes.". 

The judicial commission ( Justice Thomas) that probed the incident concluded that leaders of the Indian Union Muslim League were directly involved in both the conspiracy and execution of the massacre. Chief Minister A. K. Antony opposed any CBI probe into the massacre.
 
The courts on 27 December 2008 and 15 January 2009 sentenced 62 Muslims to life imprisonment for committing the massacre in 2009 – most of whom belonged to the Indian Union Muslim League, People's Democratic Party, and National Development Front. 76 were acquitted for lack of evidence.
