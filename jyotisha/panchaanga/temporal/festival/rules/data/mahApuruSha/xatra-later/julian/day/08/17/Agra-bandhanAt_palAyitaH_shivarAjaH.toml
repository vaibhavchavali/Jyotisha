shrAvaNa k12. A few days earlier on 13th, rAmasiMha had refused to receive shivAjI, who had been ordered to be moved to rAjA viTThaldAs's mansion.

Shivaji pulled off one of the greatest escapes in history from the jaws of death at Agra. In a story corroborated by multiple contemporary sources, shivAjI feigned illness after being put under house arrest. He started sending alms and food to holy men; and gifts to noblemen. In the initial days, guards search these outgoing baskets - later they became lax. One day Hiroji Farzand wore his master's clothes and slept in bed, with only a hand with shivAjI's wristlet being uncovered; a boy massaging his feet. shivAjI and his son escaped in the baskets. The following day, guards were fooled by seeing Hiroji. After a while hIrojI to switched to his own clothes and went away. Mogols discovered the escape the next day.

rAmasiMha (whom many tried to implicate along with jayasiMha) was in a soup - and dismissed from service. 4 brAhmaNas who were part of rAmasiMha's inner guard circle were arrested and tortured till they made a false confession. Treasure left behind by shivAjI was confiscated as "harAm ka mAl" and sold off.

Later events:

12th September 1666: Shivaji arrives at Rajgad. There are rumours (likely circulated by shivAjI) that his son died on the way. (Rajasthani letter dated 19th November 1666, newsletter of the Mughal Court dated 4th November 1666). In fact, Shivaji had left his son behind at Mathura, supposedly with his ministers' brAhmaNa relatives. (Sabhasad and A.Q. Chronicles, Tarikh-i Dilkusha, etc.) 

20th November 1666: Sambhaji arrives at Rajgad (Jedhe Chronology corrected.)
