On this day, thousands of sAdhu-s protesting against cow slaughtered were fired upon by police under Indira G. While the official report said that 375 Hindus (250 sAdhu-s) were killed in the firing, according to participants, the number is about 5000. As per Hindu Panchang, that day was Kartik Shukla Ashtami of Vikram Samvat, known as Gopashtami among Hindus.

It is believed that after the incident, the dead Hindus were ruthlessly loaded in trucks and transported in the dark of night to the ridge area outside Delhi. Without even checking that some of them may be alive, they were burnt.

## Events
On the morning of 7 November, a few hundred thousand people, predominantly from the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, Hindu Mahasabha, and Arya Samaj, had assembled from far-off places at an open space near the Parliamentary Complex. A vast majority of them were Sadhus. Swami Rameshwaranand, a Jan Sangh legislator who'd been expelled for 10 days rose to the podium and urged the protestors to  "to teach a lesson" by forcing the Parliament to close down. The mob broke barricades, police responded with tear gas and cane clubs. Then at around 1:30 pm, the police engaged in rifle fire and mounted a charge with lead-tipped clubs. Then the aforementioned killing and burning happened.

## Aftermath
A curfew was imposed; army deployed, unlawful assembly banned. About 1,500 demonstrators, including over 500 ascetics and prominent leaders of Hindu Nationalist parties and SGMS, were arrested. Beginning on 17 November, Sadhus started courting arrest, as planned. On the 20th, Prabhudutt Brahmachari and the Shankaracharya of Puri began hunger strikes; others soon followed.

Indira used this time to set up a joint parliamentary committee (deliberately filled with trusted secularists, federalists and people with an economic interest in the beef trade) - their agenda was to examine the 'feasibility' of a 'total ban on the slaughter of the cow and its progeny' and deliver a recommendation within a time frame of six months. In the meantime, Gandhi once again recommended on 5 January 1967 that states enact their own bans on cow slaughter. The next Home Minister (from 14 November 1966 to 27 June 1970) and a puppet of Indira Gandhi, Yashwantrao Balwantrao Chavan went to the fasting saints and promised to bring the ‘anti-slaughter bill’ in the next session of parliament and the saints ended their fasting. But, the Congress government never kept their promise.

Overall, the agitation propelled the Hindu Right into the foreground of national politics for the first time. The episode also played a significant role in Gandhi's choosing to shift away from the staunch secular ideals displayed by her father, embracing the Hindu way of life.
