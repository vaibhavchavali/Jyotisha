On this day, the crazy yet functional president of Uganda, "His Excellency, President for Life, Field Marshal Al Hadji Doctor Idi Amin Dada, VC, DSO, MC, CBE, Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Seas and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular", ordered the expulsion of his country's Indian (mostly Hindu) minority, giving them 90 days to leave the country.

At the time of the expulsion, there were approximately 80,000 individuals of South Asian descent in Uganda, of whom 23,000 had had their applications for citizenship both processed and accepted. A further 50,000 were British passport holders.

## Context
- British rulers had brought in Indian laborers to build railways. After the job, some 6,724 remained. Thence their numbers grew. 
- They came to be well-off relative to the natives. Asians owned many large businesses in Uganda but the purge of Asians from Uganda's economy was virtually total. Gated ethnic communities served elite healthcare and schooling services.
- Milton Obote's government had pursued a policy of "Africanisation". Indophobia was already engrained by the start of Amin's rule in February 1971.

## Aftermath
- 27,200 emigrated to the United Kingdom. 6,000 went to Canada (egged by Aga Khan in favor of Nizari Ismailis), 4,500 refugees ended up in India and 2,500 went to nearby Kenya or to Pakistan. Kenya and Tanzania similarly closed their borders to stop refugees. UN organized an airlift when Idi telegrammed them hinting at Hitler.
- Even those who had formal Ugandan citizenship chose to leave rather than endure further intimidation, with less than 4,000 known to have stayed. By the time Amin's regime collapsed in 1979, it was rumoured that there were no more than 50 Asians in Uganda.
- Some 5,655 firms, ranches, farms, and agricultural estates were expropriated (their sale having been deliberately restricted), along with cars, homes and other household goods. Aka  "Operation Mafuta Mingi". 
- Ugandan soldiers during this period engaged in theft and physical and sexual violence against the Asians with impunity.
- There was international condmenation. United Kingdom froze a £10.4 million loan.
- While the expulsion was initially popular in Uganda, mismanagement of the resources resulted in economic difficulties.
- Thousands of Indians returned to Uganda starting in 1986 when Yoweri Museveni assumed power and invited them back.
