After 5 years of war, as seige of purandar drew on, shivAjI met with jayasimha after obtaining personal assurance for his safety. Formally declaring his surrender into imperial service, he haggled till midnight. He strategically surrendered 23 forts out of 35 forst demanded (Purandar, Rudramal, Kondana, Karnala, Lohagad, Isagad, Tung, Tikona, Rohida fort, Nardurga, Mahuli, Bhandardurga, Palaskhol, Rupgad, Bakhtgad, Morabkhan, Manikgad (Raigad), Saroopgad, Sagargad, Marakgad, Ankola, Songad, and Mangad). He agreed to send his son to mughals as a mansabdAr. Much of these were part of the nizAmshAhI konkan ceded to Awrangzeb by Adil shAh but captured by shivAjI.

jayasiMha did not treacherously seize or kill shivAjI - to get continued complaiance from marAThas (as per his letter to awrangzeb). Awrangzeb confirmed the treaty in a farmAn dated 5th Sep. With this, shivAjI's secret alliance with AdilshAhi-s was broken - and shivAjI started capturing the part of Adil shAhI territory reserved for him under the treaty.
