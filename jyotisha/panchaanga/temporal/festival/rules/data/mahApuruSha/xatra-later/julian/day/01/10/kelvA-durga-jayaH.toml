Marathas again attacked Kelwa. The Maratha attack was greatly resisted by Portuguese garrison. Marathas burnt a gun-powder depot in the fort, which caused a huge blast, claiming many Portuguese lives.

## Context
Marathas found Kelwa fort difficult to conquer initially. Initially Chimaji Appa gave the command of this mission to conquer Kelve to Vitthal Vishwanath & Awaji Kawade. But the Marathas had to retreat due to strong Portuguese counter-attack. After that to conquer Kelwa, Peshwa Bajirao changed the command to Ramchandra Hari Patwardhan. He also had to retreat. This infuriated many Maratha Sardars, & even Peshwa Bajirao. Bajirao ordered Ramchandra to take strict action against the wrongdoers & deserters!
