One brother bAji rAv makes a dash to mogol Delhi, outmanoeuvring 2 armies; same day his younger bro chimAji appa readies to mount an attack on the Firangis.
The Badshah at Delhi slept secure in the thought that the large armies of Sadat, Bangash & Khan Dauran to his south would protect him. From Gwalior area, Bajirao rode 200 km in just 4 days avoiding all those armies & gatecrashed Delhi. Then, he defeated a well trained Mughal Army led by Amir Khan Bahadur.
