On this day, fear of the Marathas grips Aurangzeb and he falls down and hurts his leg in the lavatory and remains lame for rest of his life continuing the legacy of his ancestor Taimurlang. (Muntakhabulubab of Khafi Khan, vol 2, page 476) The below account is from "History of Aurangzib [v5](https://archive.org/details/aurangzeb-1-2-jadunath-sarkar/Aurangzeb-5%20%28Jadunath%20Sarkar%29/page/131/mode/1up) ch 54, pg 138 by jAduNath sarkar.

> After five weeks' rest at Bhushangarh, the imperial camp was shifted (on 30th August 1700), to Khawaspur,(17.30 N. 75.1 E. on the Man river; 36 m. east of Bhushangarh, and 14 m. s. e. of Mhasvad.) 36 miles off, where food-stuffs and grass were abundant. Khawaspur stands on the left bank of the Man, a small waterless stream at that point. The tents of the army covered both its banks and even its dry bed, which in that season presented "only the mirage of water." But in the night of 1st October, while the men were fast asleep, a high flood caused by heavy and untimely rainfall on the hills, came suddenly sweeping through the river bed, overtopped its banks and spread over the plains beyond, "turning the land into one sheet of water." Many men and animals perished; many more, including even the nobles, were left absolutely poor and naked; nearly all the tents and property were damaged. Happily, the water went down early in the morning, otherwise "not one man would have survived." [M. A. 431, K. K. ii. 475.]
>
> When the flood first struck the camp, a little before midnight, and the tents began to fill with water, men tried to run to safety, but could see no path of escape in the darkness, only waves on all sides. A loud cry arose throughout the army. The Emperor was in his privy when this universal outcry reached his ears. Imagining that the Marathas had burst into the camp, he rose in alarm, but stumbled and dislocated his right knee. The doctors failed to set it properly, and he remained a little lame for the rest of his life. (He took his bath of recovery, on leaving the sick-bed, on 30th November. [Akhbarat.]) The Court flatterers used to console him by saying that it was the heritage of his ancestor Timur the Lame and a token that he would repeat the victories and success of that world-conqueror! [K. K. 476, Storia, 255, Dil. ii. 134a.]
