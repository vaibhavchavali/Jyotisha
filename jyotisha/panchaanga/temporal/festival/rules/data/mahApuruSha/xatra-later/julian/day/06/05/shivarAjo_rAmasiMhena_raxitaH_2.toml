shivAjI was under strict house arrest since 25th May after his petition to return home in exchange for 20 million Rs was refused. Quote below is from Mehendale's book.

"Soon afterwards, probably on 5th June, it was reported to the Emperor that Shivaji's and Ram Singh's men were daily coming to Agra. The report was probably false. But it was enough to infuriate the Emperor. He ordered Siddi Fulad and the men of the artillery: "Go and seize Shivaji and kill him." But it would seem that by this time Shivaji had won over not only Jafar Khan and Muhammad Amin Khan but the Emperor's elder sister Jahan Ara as well, for she at once urged the Emperor: "Mirza Raja [Jai Singh] is a sincere servant of Your Majesty. Shivaji came here relying upon his assurance. If you kill him now no one will have any faith in your word." It was due to her intervention that the Emperor rescinded the order. It was probably this incident which led Ram Singh to take additional precautions for Shivaji's safety. Since 5th June, Ram Singh's men began keeping watch around Shivaji inside the circle of guards which had been posted by the Emperor's orders. Ram Singh justified this saying that the Emperor had kept Shivaji in his custody and he would be held responsible if Shivaji escaped or committed suicide."

jayasiMha too helped: "After the incident of 12th May, the Emperor had written to Jai Singh informing him of what had occurred and had asked for his advice in the matter. To this, according to the Alamgirnama, Jai Singh had replied that as he had concluded a treaty and covenant with Shivaji, he would be obliged if Shivaji's offences would be pardoned and that such a policy would also be advantageous in view of the campaign against Bijapur. He also instructed Ram Singh to ensure that Shivaji remained safe and the sanctity of his and Ram Singh's promises to Shivaji remained inviolate. At first Jai Singh had even beseeched the Emperor to let Shivaji return home.
