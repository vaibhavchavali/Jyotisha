It was ramzAn. Shayista Khan was occupying shivAjI's palace lAl mahal in puNyanagarI. shivAjI arrived at night and infiltrated at night (tales say - pretending to be a marriage party, others say - pretending to be part of the mogol army). shivAjI and co entered via kitchen, killed the cooks. Maid servants alerted shaiste khAn (who supposedly hid in the bed chamber). In the following scuffle, as he was hiding to escape, shaiste lost his fingers (to shivAjI's sword, they say). His eldest son, son in law, 40-50 men were killed. Few women were wounded. shivAjI's side: 6 killed, 40 wounded. Then shivAjI escaped quickly, crossed the river, and escaped back - aided by cavalry detachments placed on the way. 

Mogols suspected that this attack was done in connievance of the mogol rAjaputra general jasvant singh rAthoD, who was nearby with a 10k strong force. He did not order a chase as Marathas retreated. Shaista taunted Maharaja next morning- since you did not show up at night, I thought you had died fighting! 

Shaiste (who was incidentally fluent in sanskrit) went back; was dismissed by awrangzeb from deccan and reappointed to bengal (not being allowed to show his face). This daredevil attack raised shivAjI's prestige all over India. Jats also would disgrace Shaista Khan a few years later again when during his tenure as Agra’s governor, they loot the mausoleum of emperor’s parents- Taj Mahal!
