On this day, during the Sino-Indian War in 1962, Charlie ‘C’ company of 13 Kumaon, consisting of 124 Ahirs, heroically stopped Chinese at Rezang La. 114 out of about 120 Indians died killing about 1k Chinese soldiers.

## The fight
The company was led by Major Shaitan Singh, who won a posthumous Param Vir Chakra for his actions. From the Indian point of view, Rezang La had the drawback that an intervening feature blocked artillery operation, so that the Indian infantry had to do without artillery cover.

> When Rezang La was later revisited dead jawans were found in the trenches still holding on to their weapons... every single man of this company was found dead in his trench with several bullets or splinter wounds. The 2-inch mortar man died with a bomb still in his hand. The medical orderly had a syringe and bandage in his hands when the Chinese bullet hit him... Of the thousand mortar bombs with the defenders, all but seven had been fired and the rest were ready to be fired when the (mortar) section was overrun.

## Aftermath
The inscription on the War Memorial at Chushul, Ladakh raised by the Indian Army in memory of the soldiers who died in the Battle of Rezang La, reads as below:

> How can a man die better,  
Than facing fearful odds,  
For the ashes of his fathers,  
And temples of his gods.
