On this day, Hari Singh Nalwa, Misr Diwan Chand and others at the head of about 25k khAlsa troops won Multan after a 3 month seige. Nawab Muzaffar Khan and sons were killed defending the fort.

## Context
The Sikh Empire had attacked Multan multiple times in the past, the largest attack being in 1810. However, on the previous occasions the Sikh forces would defeat the defending force and seize the city only to have the governor of Multan, Muzaffar Khan Sadozai, retreat into the Multan Fort. During previous sieges, the Sikhs had settled for large single payments of tribute, while the attack in 1810 resulted in Multan paying a yearly tribute. 

## Aftermath
The siege of Multan ended significant Afghan influence in the Peshawar region and led to multiple Sikh attempts at capturing and the final capture of Peshawar.
