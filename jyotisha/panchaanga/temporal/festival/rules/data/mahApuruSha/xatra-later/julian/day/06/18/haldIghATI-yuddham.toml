On this day, pratApasiMha and his subjects (from all varNa-s including v1 and v3 to bhils) fought mogols at haldIghATI.

The mogol side was led by the traitorous Kacchavaha general of Akbar, Man Singh. They outnumbered pratAp's side 5:1; and were filled with professional soldiers. (Prof K S Gupta: Most Rajput treaties [eg. 1569 Bundi-Mughal treaty] with Akbar had a clause that they would not be asked to join arms against Mewar. Kachhwahas were the only exception.)

From Vanguard to rear:

- 85 Arab commandos under the vicious Arab general Sayyid Hashim al Barhai.
- Then, Kacchavaha Hindu horsemen led by Rao Jagannath + horsemen of Mohammedan Mongols under Baqshi Ali Asaf Khan, the Khwaja of Kazvin in Persia. 
- Then the Iltmish brigade under the cousin of Man Singh, Madhav Singh with the second Kacchavaha corps. The center was under Man Singh with the third Kacchavaha force.
- 3 brigades of the left wing: 
  - Tajiks under Mullah Ghazi Khan, the veteran Jihadist from Tajikistan.
  - The traitor Rao Lonakarna leading a force of Kacchavahas from the Sambhar lake.
  - The Shaikhzada division formed by the prolific clansmen of Sufi Shaikh Salim Chishti.
- The right-wing was formed by the vicious Arab clansmen of Sayyid Hashim al Barhai. 
- The rear-guard was formed by the brigade of Mihtar Khan and his Central Asian Kazakh warriors.

pratApasiMha's side:

- frontline charging force under Ramdas Rathod, the valiant son of Jaimal who died defending Chittor. Supported by Bhim Singh, the Rao Chundavat, and Hakim Khan Sur with his fellow Pathans who stayed true to his pledge despite being enticed for jihAd (Afghans having been deposed by bAbur's invasion).
- Pratap in the center with his elite rAjaputras.
- 2 brigades of the right wing
  - Ram Singh Tanwar the king of Gwalior
  - vaishya division under the valiant 3 sons and the brother Tarachand of the rich businessman Bahman (aka bhAmA) Shah
- Left wing - Jhala clan of the Rajputs under Mana
- Reserve
  - brahmin brigade led by Pratap’s purohita Jagannatha
  - brigade formed by the Mehta businessmen and the Charanas
  - Bhil archers under the Bhil chieftain Panja

Thus, all sections of the Hindu society were represented in the struggle to defend against Islamist gAzi-s.

Outcome: Fierce battle. mahArANA pratAp wounded, as was his horse chetak. He escaped to fight on from the forests. By 1579, pratApasiMha would recover much of the western part of his kingdom. Chittor and the rest of eastern Mewar continued to remain under Mughal control.
