Captain Vikram Batra of 13th battalion, Jammu and Kashmir Rifles, called Shershah by pAkistani jihAdist enemies for his prior bravery, died capturing Point 4875 on this day.

Area Flat Top, an adjacent peak and part of enemy defences on Point 4875 was being held by Capt. N.A. Nagappa till he was rendered unconscious by a shell. Vikram Batra, though still recovering from earlier injuries, insisted on going up to help. Seeing Batra's determination to save Peak 4875 and the honour of his battalion, several of his company's soldiers volunteered to accompany him even before any official orders had been issued. Just before leaving, Batra along with the 25 men of D Coy who were to accompany him, prayed at the Durga Mata temple. 

His company was tasked to clear a narrow feature with sharp cuttings on either side and heavily fortified enemy defences that covered the only approach to it. For speedy operation, Captain Batra assaulted the enemy position along a narrow ridge and engaged the enemy in a fierce hand –to-hand fight and killed five enemy soldiers at point blank range. Despite sustaining grave injuries, he crawled towards the enemy and hurled grenades clearing the position. Though it was pitch dark, on a foggy snowy night with a near vertical climb, Batra downed 3 machine gun positions. By the time they reached the top, it was daylight. Not finding an alternate route to reach Capt Nagappa, they decided to make a direct daylight frontal assault. Under heavy fire from enemy machine guns and grenade launchers, the captain shouted 'Durga mata ki jai', and charged the sangar firing incessantly from his AK-47. Despite injury, he managed to breach it, punch a pAki soldier on the nose before bayoneting him (and downing another). They further captured a machine gun nest, killing 4 pAkis. Realising that one of his men was shot, Batra decided to evacuate him - positioning himself in the front saying 'You have a family and children to go back to, I'm not even married.'. Then he was fatally shot by enemy sniper, and an RPG splinter caught him.

Earlier victory: During ‘Operation Vijay’, on 20 June 1999, Captain Vikram Batra, Commander Delta Company was tasked to attack Point 5140 of Dras. Leading from the front, he in a daredevil assault, pounced on the enemy and killed four of them in a hand-to hand fight.  He radioed the predetermined code: 'Yeh Dil Mange More!'. Batra was promoted to the rank of captain, and congradulated by the Army chief.
