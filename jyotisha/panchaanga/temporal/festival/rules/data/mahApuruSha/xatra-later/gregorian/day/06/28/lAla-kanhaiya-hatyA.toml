On this anniversary  (as per Gregorian calendar) of the battle of Haldighati, in the very same udayapura of mahrANa pratApasiMha, at about 2:45PM, two young jihAdis - Mohammed Riyaz Akhtar and Mohammed Ghous - posing as customers suddenly attacked and murdered a tailor kanhaiya lAl when he was taking measurements. They had circulated videos threatening to carry out the attack (and instigating correligionist mobsters to do the same); also a video of the attack, and further a post-attack video boasting of the attack with display of bloody butcher knifes, with threats to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

## Motive
Nupur Sharma, BJP spokesperson, in a heated TV debate in the background of the discovery of a shiva-linga being used to wash feet in jNAnavApI masjid in kAshI and subsequent mocking of hindu reverence, had referred to the account (from the authoritative Islamic hadis shAhih bhukari) of impregnation of a 9 year old by "sab se nek insAn" of the "religion of peace". This upset a lot of muslims, who began making death threats to varied hindu-s, including those who supported Nupur Sharma's right to refer to authoritative Islamic beliefs about their prophet - This despite BJP suspending Nupur Sharma in appeasement of Islamic countries and people, Nupur's apology, and several police complaints and legal action against her. 

One of these was kanhaiya lAl, whose social media account had shared some post in support of Nupur. (kanhaiya claimed that it was his son who had inadvertantly shared this post.) On June 11, Lal's neighbor Nazim had registered a police complaint against him - but kanhaiya got bail. On June 15, Lal had filed a request for protection with the local police after receiving death threats from nAzim and five others. Lal alleged that the group had circulated his photo within their community on social media with a message that Lal should be killed if seen anywhere or if he opens his shop. The police - instead of protecting him, claimed to have mediated and settled the matter. 

## Radicalization
Both the killers had gone on Haj Umrah pilgrimage.

Mohammed Ghous had, according to later police statements, had developed links with Dawat-e-Islami and Tehrik-e-Labiak (barelvi), the Islamist organizations from the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, had visited that terrorist state in 2014 and maintained whatsapp contact thereafter.

Riyaz Akhtari used to work at a local mosque in Udaipur and was involved in spreading religious propaganda. He had lived in Dubai. Even as he was quite radicalized (he acquired in 2013 the bike number 2611 acquired at cost of Rs 5k - reminiscent of the date of mumbai islamic terror attack by Ajmal Kasab and co), and even though he used to criticize BJP in private, he used to attend BJP events and tried to infiltrate the party. Riyaz's family had vacated their house on the day of the butchery. He crafted the knifes used for the murder.

## Egging by the ulema
Ajmer Sufi Dargah - whose Sarwar Chishti said he will make India tremble through his upcoming agitation; whose Gauhar Chishti met Udaipur killers; whose Salman Chishti announced a reward for beheading Nupur - has an annual income of Rs 200 crores (70% from Hindus).

## Aftermath
A handful of people were there at the place, all fled - only a Rajput assistant, Ishwar Singh fought the Jihadis, sustained severe injuries and was admitted to Maharana Bhupal Hospital.) The assailants fled on foot and then drove away on a motorcycle (with special number 2611). Rajput boys Shakti Singh and Prahlad Singh Chudawat of Rajsamand trailed the Udaipur killers and helped Police nab them.

Members of Hindu organizations instantly protested, and refused to allow the police to remove the body until the culprits were captured at 8 PM.

Local authorities of Udaipur imposed a 24-hour curfew and blocked internet access across the state of Rajasthan. Thousands of people rallied and protested in udayapura. Within a day of the murder, hindus had gathered over a crore rupees for the Hindu tailor's family and that of the injured Ishvar Singh.
