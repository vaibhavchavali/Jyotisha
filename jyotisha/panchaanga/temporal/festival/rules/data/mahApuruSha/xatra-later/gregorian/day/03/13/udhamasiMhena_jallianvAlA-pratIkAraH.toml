Udham Singh shot and killed Michael O'Dwyer, Governor of the Punjab in 1919, for ordering the Jallianwala Bagh massacre (in which his brother and sister died).

Singh was immediately arrested and held in Brixton prison. There he staged a thirty-six day hunger strike, which resulted in him being forcibly fed through a tube; then tried and executed. He said: "I did not take the revolver to kill but just to protest. ... I have seen people starving in India under British Imperialism. I done it, the pistol went off three or four times. I am not sorry for protesting. "
