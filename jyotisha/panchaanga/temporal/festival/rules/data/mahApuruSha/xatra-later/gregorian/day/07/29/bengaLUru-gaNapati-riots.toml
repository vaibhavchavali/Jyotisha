On this day, Muslim rioters showered stones, slippers and even bullets at Hindus reinstalling a gaNapati shrine in their school, which was opposite to Municipal president Abbas Khan's house.

## Context 
In June 1928, the students of Hindu Anglo-Vernacular School, Sultanpet, Bengaluru, requested the contractor who was undertaking repair work to the school building, to construct a small shrine or niche over an existing Ganesha idol in a passage of the Hindu Anglo-Vernacular School. The Director of Public Instructions had it stowed away. Students (including those of neighboring schools) demanded that it be restored. This act had the support of an editorial in a newspaper Veerakesari run by Sitarama Sastri; among others. Indian National Congress leaders Ramlal Tiwari, Jamkandi Bhima Rao and H. V. Subramanyam too supported the students. The idol dispute soon evolved into a general protest by Hindus over Muslim dominance and bias in the administration and bureaucracy.

Tiwari, Subrahmanyam and Bhima Rao were arrested on 27 July 1928. A procession of students made its way to Central Jail, Bengaluru where the arrested leaders were kept and were lathi-charged by the state police. The idol was restored to its original place on 29 July  and worship at the Ganapati shrine was renewed by over 5,000 Hindus, which prompted the Muslims to attack them with shouts of "Deen, Deen".  

## Events
Muslims fired from a roof of a nearby cycle shop and also reportedly from the upper floor of the house of Abbas Khan and at least one boy was hit by a bullet.  123 Hindus and 11 Muslims were injured before the government brought the situation under control.

## Aftermath
The Diwan, Sir Mirza Ismail, advised the Maharaja of Mysore, who was residing at Mysuru, "not to come from Mysore to Bangalore till after (the) arrested leaders have been tried". The Maharaja of Mysore constituted a committee headed by Sir M. Visvesvaraya to enquire into the disturbances, and the committee observed that law and order was completely broken down during the disturbances and the government favoured one side (ie the muslims) in the incident. Noted journalist and scholar DV Gundappa, who had high regard for Mirza Ismail before the incident, stopped talking to him for a long time.
