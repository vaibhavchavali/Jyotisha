The young but bold and astute visionary, peshvA mAdhava rAv, died of tuberculosis at his favourite Ganesha Chintamani Temple, Theur. Aged 28. Before he died, he had succeeded in reuniting the confrederacy. Grant Duff - \"And the plains of Panipat were not more fatal to the Maratha Empire than the early end of this excellent prince…\" 

Context: Madhavrao was infected with intestinal tuberculosis in May 1770. This disease is characterised by unbearable abdominal pain. Pain was such, that during his last days Madhavrao once asked for a dagger from his uncle to cut his belly so that he might escape from the terrible suffering! Madhavrao's last days were unfortunately very painful. 

He died on 18 November 1772 at 11 o' clock in the morning, with the word 'Gajanan' on his lips. Thousands of citizens visited the site and paid their last respects. Madhavrao was cremated on the banks of the river which was about half a mile from the temple. A small memorial carved out of stone rests today at that place as a memorial. His wife Ramabai chose to commit sati with his body at the time of cremation, even though Brahmin widows were not required to follow the ritual.
