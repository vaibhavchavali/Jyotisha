Veerapandya Kattabomman was hanged to death by the British from a tamarind tree at Kayathar on this date in 16 October 1799. Thread on one of the great freedom fighters, who would be an inspiration to many revolutionaries in Tamil Nadu. He was 39.

## Context
After 1781, British took over navAb of Arkot's finances, and then his army. Thence they went from strength to strength. kaTTabomman, an able warrior from an Andhra-origin family, was adapted and crowned as the ruler on February 2, 1790 by Jagaveera Pandya of Veerapandiyapuram. He repudiated British demands for humble subordination and taxes. British however successfully managed to wean away most of his neighbouring allies, ultimately went to war and won owing to superior military and finiancial might. After repeated attempts, they successfully captured him.

In the trial that followed, Kattabomman, refused to give up on his self respect, and accused the British of illegal, immoral occupation. When the British offered him amnesty, if he asked for a pardon, Kattabomman shot back - "Do what you want cowards".

## Aftermath
He would inspire a generation of freedom fighters and revolutionaries. There is a memorial at Kayathar, TN where he was hanged to death. Also Indian Navy's communication center at Vijayanarayanam is named after Kattabomman. The biopic of Veerapandya Kattabomman starring Shivaji Ganesan, is regarded as a classic in Tamil cinema.
