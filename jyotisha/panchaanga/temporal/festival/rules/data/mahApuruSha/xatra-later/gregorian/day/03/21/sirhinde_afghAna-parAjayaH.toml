The Marathas under raghunAth rAv, Mughals under Adina Beg and the Dal Khalsa (Sikh confederation) under Jassa Singh Ahluwalia attacked and captured Sirhind from Afghans on March 21, 1758.

## Context
The Marathas remembering the vision of Peshwa Baji Rao, 1720-1740, to establish Hindu Pad Padshahi (Hindu empire) and the lure of Punjab’s riches, made the first attack on Sirhind in December 1757. The Afghan governor, Abdus Samad managed to avoid battle with a tribute. Marathas returned in January 1758 with a large army under Raghunath Rao.

## Aftermath
The city was thoroughly plundered which also led to bad blood between Sikhs and Marathas as the Sikhs garnered the lion’s share. The allies then marched to Lahore. The city was abandoned by the Afghans to the “Indian alliance”. The Afghan escapees were were waylaid at Wazirabad on the Chenab. While Taimur and Jahan Khan escaped across the river, the entire treasury which was still east of the river was captured by the victors. Large scale slaughter of Afghan troops took place. The prisoners were marched by the Sikhs to Amritsar to clean the Golden Temple sarovar where dead cows and excreta had been dumped earlier by Jehan Khan.

Surprisingly despite having an army of 2,00,000 and supported by Adina Beg and the Sikhs, the Marathas did not pursue the Afghans across the Indus to deal the coupe de grace. They were content to enforce “chauth” (one forth of revenue) and “sardeshmukhi” (one tenth of revenue for king/ governor). The frontiers of Punjab were left to be guarded by 15000 - 20000 troops in widely separated forts at Multan, Peshawar and Attock. There was no unified command. Bulk of the army under Raghunath Rao and his deputy Malhar Rao Holkar made its way back to Delhi and central India.

The Marathas gave the Adina the title of Nawab and made him the overlord of Lahore and Sirhind, virtually pacing entire Punjab under him for an annual payment of rupees seventy five lakhs. They abandoned the Sikhs to the now powerful Adina who began pursuing them with vengeance for past wrongs. The Sikhs in turn began guerrilla raids on the Marathas.
