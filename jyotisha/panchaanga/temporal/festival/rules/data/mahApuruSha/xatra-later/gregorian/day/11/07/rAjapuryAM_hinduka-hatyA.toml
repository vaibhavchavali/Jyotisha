On this day, began the large scale massacre of over 30k Hindu and sikhs at rAjauri in jammu and kAshmIr state.

On 12 November 1947, there were coordinated killings of young Hindu and Sikh males ordered by Sakhi Diler and Colonel Rehmat Ullah Khan - 3k to 7k killed on that day. Later mass riots by muslim mobs started. Some fled to other places - like mIrpur (where another massacre was awaiting them). By the time Indian army recaptured Rajauri on 12 April 1948, most inhabitants were dead - though 1.5k refugees who'd fled to the hills returned.
