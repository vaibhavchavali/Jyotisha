On this day, Islamist terrorsts belonging to Al Umma, led by S. A. Basha, triggered a well planned serial bombing (12 bomb attacks in 11 places, all within a 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) radius, 13:30–15:40), killing 58-76 people and injuring 200 others.

## Events
The explosives used were found to be gelatin sticks activated by timer devices and were concealed in cars, motorcycles, bicycles, sideboxes of two-wheelers, denim and rexin bags, and fruit carts. Several bombs that failed to detonate were defused by bomb disposal squads. 3 human bombs named Amanuallah, Melapalayam Amjath Ali and Rafique alias Shanmugam, were targeting L.K. Advani, but could not penetrate the security cardon.

## Context
Coimbatore was religiously polarized. In the period between 1989 and 1997, 42 Hindus had been murdered in Coimbatore region by Islamists. Some were random killing of Hindus to ‘instill fear’ like the killing of five Hindus in one day (02-09-1997) and many were targeted executions of Hindu activists. Resolutely ignoring all IB warnings on 28th January 1997 Badsha and four others were released from Coimbatore jail by DMK regime following its decision to withdraw the TADA cases. Al-Ummah throwed pipe-bombs at director Mani Ratnam’s house as a warning against the films he directed ‘Roja’ and ‘Bombay’. (Source: Swarajya mag article)

1997 Coimbatore riots occurred between 29 November 1997 and 1 December 1997 - started by  murder of a police constable allegedly by some Muslim youth over a dispute of detention of Al-Ummah functionaries. 18 Muslims and 2 Hindus had died. Al Ummah had used the videotapes of the deceased during the riots to mobilise sympathy and garner financial support from Muslim countries

## Aftermath
People belonging to Al Ummah, Jihad Committee and the Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam (TMMK) were arrested in a State-wide crackdown. In Coimbatore district, 326 Hindus and 202 Muslims – were detained as a precautionary measure. During September 2002, Imam Ali and four others, suspected to be involved in the blasts were killed in a police encounter in Bangalore. In 2007, out of the 14 accused, 13 were found guilty of blasts and were convicted - Madani was the only one acquitted. On 17 November 2009, nine members of Al Ummah, convicted in the blasts were released from jail for their good conduct, 16 months short of their full sentence on the occasion of 100th birth anniversary of Arignar Anna, the founder of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK).

For days after the explosions, the city of Coimbatore looked like a town deserted; business establishments, shops and roadside stalls remained closed and few people ventured out. Hotels refused admission to guests. The Bharatiya Janata Party candidate C.P. Radhakrishnan won by a record margin of over 1,00,000 votes in the 1998 Lok Sabha elections.
