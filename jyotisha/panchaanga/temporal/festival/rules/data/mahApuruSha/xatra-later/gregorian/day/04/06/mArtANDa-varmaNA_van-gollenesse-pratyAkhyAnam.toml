On this day, Julius Valentyn Stein van Gollenesse, the Dutch commander at Kochi (Cochin), was told to get lost (ie there would be no treaty) by King mArtANDa varma of padmanAbhapura.

## Context
mArtANDa varma's army had been annexing and consolidating neighbouring kingdoms, while defeating the Dutch in battle after battle. There were reports that major reinforcements were due to arrive from Europe under van Imhoff - so the king started negotiating - but delaying. As soon as he learned that van Imhoff had not yet departed from Europe - that his arrival was postponed, he assumed tough bargaining positions - no special concessions for the Dutch, they were to help padmanAbhapura against French and ArkoT navAb etc.. His representatives kept backing away from terms previously agreed to.

## Aftermath
In May 1743, van Gollenesse stepped down from the Dutch command in Malabar, in order to take up charge as the Governor of Dutch Ceylon. His replacement Reinicus Siersma realized that the local chiefs of Kerala no longer feared the Dutch, and a failure to reach an agreement with Travancore would severely affect the Company's pepper trade in Malabar. On 22 May 1743, Siersma concluded a peace treaty with Travancore, accepting most of the terms proposed by Marthanda Varma. There would be further capitulation in the next treaty.
