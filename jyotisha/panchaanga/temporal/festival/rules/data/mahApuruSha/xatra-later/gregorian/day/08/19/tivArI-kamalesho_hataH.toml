Farid-ud-din Shaikh and Ashfak Shaikh came dressed in saffron kurtas to give Kamalesh Tiwari a sweets box (hiding a knife and pistol there), slit his throat and shot him. According to the police, the pistol and sweets used in the murder were bought in Surat and the murder was planned in Dubai. Several conspirators were arrested.

Context: In Dec 2015, Arun Jaitley supported decriminalization of homosexuality. Azam Khan (a criminal politician who would be jailed and illegal property seized a few years later) called RSS members homosexuals. Tiwari retaliated saying that Muhammad was the first homosexual. Tiwari was arrested and jailed for a few months, even as lakhs of muslims went into frenzy.
