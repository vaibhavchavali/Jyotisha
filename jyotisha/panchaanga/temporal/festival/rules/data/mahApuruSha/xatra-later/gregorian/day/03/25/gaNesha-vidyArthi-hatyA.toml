gaNesh shankar vidyArthI, a Hindu kAyastha journalist and nationalist, was killed on this day by a Muslim mob in kAnpur. For 4 days his mutiliated dead-body was lying on a pile of garbage. He had gone to a Muslim majority area of Kanpur to appeal for harmony - and rescue trapped Hindus.

## Context
Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi (26 October 1890 – 25 March 1931) was a journalist, an Indian National Congress leader, and a friend of Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad. He participated in the non-cooperation movement. He had translated Victor Hugo's novel Ninety-Three, and was the founder-editor of the Hindi language newspaper, Pratap. Due to his activism, he had to face numerous prosecutions, pay heavy fines and suffer five prison sentences. 

In the 1920s, hindu-muslim conflicts spread in western UP. shuddhi movement had grown popular. Even secularist congressmen asserted their defiance against Islamist mobs. For example, in February 1927, Vidyarthi and other Congress leaders had organized a demonstration to the Moolganj mosque and played music for forty minutes - in retaliation to a Muslim mob attacking a musical band accompanying a Hindu marriage procession. 

In 1931, Hindu-Muslim riots took place in Kanpur. Ganesh, recently (9 March 1931) released from jail under the Gandhi–Irwin Pact, was to leave to the Karachi Congress Session, but stayed back. Eyewitnesses note him to have rescued members of both communities; his daughter claimed in an interview that Vidyarthi was murdered while trying to rescue a group of trapped Hindus.

## Aftermath
Congress came out with a report on riots a month or so later- the document is a stellar template of secular whitewashing, and MK Gandhi declared: "His blood is the cement that will ultimately bind the two communities. No pact will bind our hearts. But heroism such as Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi showed is bound in the end to melt the stoniest hearts, melt them into one."

Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Puraskar has been given to renowned journalists by honourable President of India every year from 1989. Sevveral public places and institutions are named after him. On 18 July 2017, UP Government renamed Kanpur airport after him.
