In 1585, the shrine of Kashi Vishweshwara established.  
It was built with by minister Todar Mal, unopposed by Akbar (who had by that time grown skeptical of Islam).
It was inaugurated with worshipping the God by Narayanabhatta, the famous Tikakara of Vrittaratnakara,  
and one of the Dharmadhipatis of Kashi along with Sheshakrishna Pandit, the guru of Bhattojidikshita and others.

(Date reckoning based on supposition that the worship was conducted during Shivaratri.)

## Aftermath
It was later vandalised under Aurangzeb and overlaid by Gyanvapi masjid.
