[description]
en = "The fine autodidact pure math genius rAmAnujan was born by the grace of nAmagiri-amma to shrInivAsa ayyangAr. Under the devI's inspiration, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable. Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation. Finally he succeeded in getting GH Hardy's attention and patronage. He cried as they cut his shikhA. Used to recite sanskrit conjugations. Died at age 32. As late as 2011 and again in 2012, researchers continued to discover that mere comments in his writings about 'simple properties' and 'similar outputs' for certain findings were themselves profound and subtle number theory results that remained unsuspected until nearly a century after his death."
