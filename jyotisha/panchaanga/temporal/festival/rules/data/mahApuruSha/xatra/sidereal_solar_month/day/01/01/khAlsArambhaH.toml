On this auspicious day, the tenth Guru of Sikhs, Guru Gobind Singh Ji, laid the foundation of Khalsa. The aim behind the formation of Khalsa was to create ideal people who would be perfect in every way including devotion (Bhakti) and strength (Shakti). He introduced the new form of initiatory rites ‘Khande di pahul’ or ‘rites by the double-edged sword’ in 1699. From that day, Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh became an integral part of Sikhism.

## Events
After his address to the gathering, he invited (consecutively, 5 times) any person to offer his head for the khAlsa; taking them in and emerging with a bloody sword. These were the first 5 khAlsa members.

## Context
After the execution of Shri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji, his son Shri Guru Gobind Singh Ji (formerly known as Gobind Rai) became the tenth and last Guru of Sikhs. At that time there was a feeling of darkness and unhappiness due to the continuous atrocities of the Mughals. He vowed to turn Sikhs from “Sparrows to Hawks”. His famous words “Chidhiya naal mai baaz ladaawan, Geedadan toh main sher banawaan, Sawa lakh se ek ladawan, Tabe Gobind Singh naam kahaawan!” literally means “I shall make sparrows fight the hawk, I shall make lions out of jackals, I will teach one man to fight 1.25 lakh, Only then will I be called Gobind Singh”.

Several months before the formation of Khalsa, Shri Guru Gobind Singh Ji had sent an invitation to all his followers to come to Anandpur Sahib on Baisakhi (saura-meSha-sankrAnti) in 1699, which fell on March 30. Thousands of devotees gathered at Anandpur Sahib for the auspicious event.
