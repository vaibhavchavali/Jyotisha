en = """The Phalguna Paurnami festival is a grand five-day celebration held annually at the Swami Pushkarini. Each day of the festival features a different set of deities taken for a celestial ride on a beautifully decorated float in the temple tank.

1. On the first day, Bhagavan Rama, along with Sita and Lakshmana, are worshipped and taken for a ride on the float.
2. The second day is dedicated to Bhagavan Krishna and Rukmini, who are also offered puja and taken on the float for a pleasure ride.

For the last three days, from Trayodashi to Paurnami:
1. Sri Malayappa Swami, accompanied by Sridevi and Bhudevi, are taken out for a ride in the temple tank.
2. The third day includes three rounds of the float, increasing to five rounds on the next day.
3. On the final day, the utsava murtis (festival deities) are taken for a splendid ride on the float for seven rounds, attracting a large number of pilgrims. The beauty of the deities is further enhanced by the charm of the full moon, making this day particularly special and visually stunning."""
