Program following this day:
For 4 days - big lifestock fair, with many horses, camels, cattle; plus some rustic competitions. Camel traders always arrive and leave earlier. The first day is the finest time to survey the animals all done up in their extravagant decorations.  
As days go by, visitors increase.
Then, for 3 days - folk dances, live music shows etc..
Finally - Pushkar’s Kartik Purnima festival - pilgrims bathe in the waters of holy Lake Pushkar. Overcrowding anticipated.
