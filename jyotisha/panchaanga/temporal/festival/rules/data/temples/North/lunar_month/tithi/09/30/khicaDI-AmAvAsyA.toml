[description]
en = """KhechMavas or Khichdi Amavasya is a traditional winter ceremony of the Kashmiri Pandits, celebrated during Paush Krishna Paksha Amavasya (Purnimanta), locally known as Poh Gaet Pach Mavas. This festival, steeped in religious devotion, is a vital part of the Kashmiri religious and cultural heritage and symbolizes the region's history. It honors the Yakshas, who inhabit the Himalayan heights, stretching from modern-day Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh to Kashmir. According to lore, these beings from Kashmir's towering mountains and would descend to the plains during winter. The Kashmiri people would welcome them with the specialty dish Khichdi as a gesture of hospitality.

On the evening of Khichdi Amavasya, a special Khichdi is prepared using rice, turmeric powder, and pounded moong dal, embodying sanctity and purity. It is served on a fresh earthen plate (Toke), a handwoven grass base called Arie, or a thali, depending on local tradition (Reeth). Alongside, a pestle (Kaajvut) is placed upright on a grass-woven Arie, and a Tilak is applied before performing Pooja. Subsequently, a portion of the Khichdi is placed on the house's courtyard wall and later consumed as prasad."""
