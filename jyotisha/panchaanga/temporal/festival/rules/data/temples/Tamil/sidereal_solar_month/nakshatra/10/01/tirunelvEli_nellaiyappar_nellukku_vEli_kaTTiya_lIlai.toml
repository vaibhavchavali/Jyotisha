[description]
en = """In the ancient town of Tirunelveli, a devout worshipper of Bhagavan Shiva named Vedabhattar performed daily rituals for Bhagavan Shiva and provided food to the needy. Over time, his wealth diminished, but Vedabhattar continued his offerings and worship by seeking support from the local community. One day, he left paddy (rice grains) drying under the sun to prepare an offering for the temple, and went to bathe in the Tamraparni River. Suddenly, dark clouds gathered, and it began to rain heavily, threatening to ruin the drying paddy. Vedabhattar, anxious about his offering, prayed to Bhagavan Shiva and rushed back, only to find that a divine miracle had occurred: the paddy was untouched by rain, shielded as if by an invisible fence.

This miracle led to the town being named Tirunelveli, meaning “the place where the paddy was fenced.” This event is commemorated annually at the Nellaiappar Temple in Tirunelveli with special rituals and reenactments. (See https://www.vikatan.com/spiritual/thiruvilaiyadal-related-event-recreated-in-nellaiappar-temple-in-nellai)"""
