en = """The Arupathumoovar festival, celebrated on the eighth afternoon of the Panguni festival at the Kapaleeshwarar temple, is a grand event where Bhagavan Shiva, in a majestic procession, grants darshan to the 63 Nayanmars. All the 63 Nayanmars are taken out in procession on this day! While this is itself not unique, as it is celebrated by several Shiva temples as part of their annual brahmotsavam-s, the story of Poompavai and related observances make this festival very unique at Kapaleeshwarar temple! This description, from a 1910 article in Viveka Bodhini magazine, captures the essence of the festival and the story of Poompavai.

The story revolves around Sivanesan Chettiar, a wealthy Mylapore businessman, who plans to marry his daughter Poompavai to Saint Thirugnanasambandar (the 28th of the Nayanmars). Tragically, Poompavai dies from a snake bite and is cremated. Chettiar preserves her ashes, hoping for her revival by Thirugnanasambandar. When the Saint arrives and sings the Poompavai Pathigam, the girl miraculously resurrects. Chettiar offers her hand in marriage, but the Saint, considering himself her father after her rebirth, declines.

On Arupathumoovar day, this episode is reenacted with idols of Saint Thirugnanasambandar and Sivanesan Chettiar in processions, followed by elaborate rituals and offerings. The idol of Poompavai, too, is brought out and placed in a pandal. The event culminates with the odhuvar of Kapaleeshwarar temple reciting the Poompavai Pathigam, describing various temple festivals and lamenting Poompavai's absence from them. Each verse ends with arathi to Thirugnanasambandar, and at the recital's conclusion, Poompavai's curtain is removed for a grand arathi. The trio then joins the procession of nayanmars, leading Bhagavan Shiva’s procession, which starts around 3 p.m. and lasts several hours.

Conversations with a temple priest shed light on the traditional practices that continue to be part of the enactment of the Poompavai episode, largely unchanged over time. The abhishekam offerings for Sivanesan Chettiar, for instance, are provided by his community's representatives, who operate from a mandapam located opposite the temple's Eastern Gopuram. Before the Poompavai Pathigam is sung, the Thiruthondar Puranam is recited, detailing the events leading up to Thirugnanasambandar's arrival in Mylapore. A cloth-covered pot filled with jaggery is placed, symbolizing the urn holding Poompavai’s ashes, as preserved by Sivanesan Chettiar. At the conclusion of the Poompavai Pathigam, this pot is opened, and the jaggery inside is distributed as prasadam to those present.

The article also highlights several unchanged traditions, like offerings for Sivanesan Chettiar's abhishekam brought by community representatives and the distribution of jaggery prasadam, symbolizing Poompavai's ashes. It marvels at the huge crowds, estimated at four to five lakh, and notes the stopping of vehicular traffic by 2 p.m. Various charitable activities, like serving water, buttermilk, paanakam, and organizing annadaanam, are detailed, with special mention of the longstanding Sivaganasambandar Thaneer Pandal and distribution of cow's milk for children. The article concludes noting the extensive reach of these services, a tradition that continues to this day."""
