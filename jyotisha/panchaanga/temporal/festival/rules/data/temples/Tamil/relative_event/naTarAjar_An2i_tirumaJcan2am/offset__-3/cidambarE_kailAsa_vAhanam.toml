[description]
en = "The Brahmotsavam of Nataraja at Chidambaram happens specially around the Aani Thirumanjana festival each year, for ten days. On this day, Nataraja gives darshan on a Kailasha vahanam: Bhagavan Somaskanda—Shiva with Uma and Skanda—seated on Mount Kailasha as Ravananugraha-murti. In his frustration at being ignored, Ravana tried to shake the sacred mountain. Shiva subdued him with his big toe. In response, Ravana transformed one of his ten heads into a veena, using his own veins as strings, and began playing and singing praises of Shiva."
