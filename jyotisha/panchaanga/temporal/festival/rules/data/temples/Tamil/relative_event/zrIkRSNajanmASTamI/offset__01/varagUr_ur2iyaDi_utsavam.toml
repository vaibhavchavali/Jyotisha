Varagur, nestled on the banks of the Kudamurutti River (`kuDamuruTTi`), a tributary of the Kaveri, is a quaint village steeped in spiritual heritage. It is renowned for its connection with the revered Narayana Theertha Swamigal, the composer of Krishna Leela Tharangini, who achieved Deva Mukthi here following the Vishvarupa Darshan of Shri Venkatesha Perumal. This village, initially known as Bhoopathi Rajapuram and located in the Thanjavur district of Tamil Nadu, India, is often referred to as “Heaven on Earth” (Bhoolaka Vaikuntam). With a history spanning over a thousand years, Varagur's picturesque main street starts from the Kathungalaaru brook and is adorned with significant temples, including the Pillayar temple with its pond, the Maha Kailasanatha Kovil (https://maps.app.goo.gl/mqDK3jqVD5DZfZ5u5), and the prominent Sri Venkatesa Perumal Kovil (https://maps.app.goo.gl/LkiXdeUoB1YUpxCf6).

The village's principal deity, Sri Venkatesa Perumal, originally installed as Sri Lakshmi Narayana by Paranthaka Chola, known as Veera Narayanan, represents a pinnacle of Chola period architecture. The arrival of Sri Narayana Theertha Swamigal from Andhra Pradesh, who sought blessings from Sri Venkatesa Perumal, marked a significant chapter in the village's history, leading to its renaming as Varahapuri, and eventually, Varagur. Varagur's cultural calendar is highlighted by the Uriyadi Utsavam, a grand festival commencing on Gayathri Japam Day, the day after Avani Avittam, and spanning ten days up to the day after Janmashtami."""
