[description]
en = "Every year, on Pongal day, there is a unique festival celebrated in the Madurai Meenakshi temple, to commemorate a unique happening, when Abhisheka Pandian ruled over Madurai. Once, the King was desirous of knowing the greatness of a saint in the temple, and requested him to demonstrate his powers by feeding a sugarcane to a stone elephant (sculpture). This festival celebrates this event, where the King was bewildered by the powers of the saint, who eventually blessed the King and soldiers."
