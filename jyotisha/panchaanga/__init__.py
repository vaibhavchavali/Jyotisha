Panchangam
==========

This project computes a *Pañcāṅgam* for a given location and given year.
It uses ephemeris positions to (somewhat
accurately) calculate important aspects of a day, particularly the five
*aṅgas*, viz. *tithi* (moon phase), *nakshatra* (asterism), *yoga*,
*karaṇa* and *vāra*, and also the occurrence of various Hindu
festival_id_to_instance, which are usually decided by elaborate rules dependent on the
(combinations of the) *aṅgas*.
