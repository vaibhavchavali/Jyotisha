On this night, Muslim Kashmiri soldiers led by Major Nasarullah Khan brutally massaccred their Hindu fellows (some in their sleep) and joined Pakistani Islamist invaders.

## Killing 
On the night of 15/16 October 1947, a large party of raiders laid siege to Tharochi Fort where two companies of 2 J&K Battalion, one Gorkha and one Muslim had taken refuge. Brigadier Chhattar Singh in command of the Mirpur Brigade ordered his Brigade Major (BM), Major Nasarullah Khan to take two platoons of 3 JAK Battalion to deliver supplies and ammunition to the garrison in the Fort. 

### The garrison
On the way, he also assumed command of two companies sent earlier to relieve the besieged garrison. He deployed the Muslim Company on perimeter defense duty outside the Fort and told the Gorkhas to rest. Nasarullah Khan then called a meeting of all Muslim officers and JCOs and hatched a plan to eliminate the non-Muslim elements. During the night, the Muslim Company mercilessly butchered the sleeping Gorkhas! The Gorkha Commander, Captain Prem Singh was strangled to death by Muslim brother officers of his own battalion. Two Gorkha JCOs and 30 Other Ranks (OR) managed to escape the massacre.

### The fort
Major Nasarullah Khan then led the Muslim troops inside the Tharochhi Fort where the garrison, was unaware of the developments of the night before and received the relieving column with joy. And at night, the unsuspecting Gorkhas were all murdered in a repeat performance. Their commander, Captain Raghubir Singh Thapa was tortured to death!

## Context
Such betrayal by almost all the Muslim soldiers in the Maharaja’s army led to the crisis which followed.
